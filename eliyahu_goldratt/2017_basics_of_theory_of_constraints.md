[0:00:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=0) what is TLC can anyone tell me what it  
[0:00:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5) is you know there was a time it was so  
[0:00:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=9) easy to define but then it grew in  
[0:00:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=11) mushroom then mushroom and now what the  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=13) hell is it about a year ago I was forced  
[0:00:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=22) to really give some serious thinking to  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=27) define it what happened is at one of our  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=30) crazy friends professor Jim Cox I've  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=35) decided that you see now is so big that  
[0:00:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=38) it's about time to write the handbook of  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=41) TOC so he went out and marked about 40  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=47) TOC world experts and approached each  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=50) one of them and convince each one to  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=55) write a chapter for the handbook giving  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=57) him a title and then he said ok you can  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=62) write the introduction to the handbook  
[0:01:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=64) from the perspective of the founder now  
[0:01:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=67) how can you say no now so I said fine  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=71) but then what do you write what am I  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=76) going to write what how do you put an  
[0:01:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=80) introduction to all of to see without  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=82) being totally stupid so this took a lot  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=87) of time thinking I think that what  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=93) helped me was a very famous story in the  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=97) Jewish tradition this is a true story  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=100) about around 30 ad which means almost  
[0:01:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=109) 2,000 years old and the story is about a  
[0:01:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=112) Gentile and non Jew that came to the two  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=117) great rabbis of his times and asked each  
[0:02:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=122) will you please teach me all of Judaism  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=125) at the time that I can still balance on  
[0:02:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=129) one leg  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=131) so one of them chased him out of the  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=134) house very brutally but the other one  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=138) abandoned and the answer is become very  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=141) famous and after that there was so much  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=144) studying to study the answer the answer  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=147) was don't do unto others what you don't  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=152) want others to do to you this is all of  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=156) Judaism everything else is direct  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=158) derivatives go and study what a  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=162) fantastic answer by the way took  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=164) hundreds of years to decipher it in  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=166) other to prove that really all of  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=168) Judaism can be deduced directly  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=170) one-to-one from one single sentence and  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=174) this gives a new meaning to what is T  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=177) you see in other words can you come up  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=179) with one sentence that encompass all of  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=183) do you see as it is now and as it will  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=185) be in the future and you can you have to  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=187) prove that all what we see under the  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=190) this umbrella after you see can be  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=193) derived directly from that sentence  
[0:03:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=195) quite a big challenge I started to work  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=199) on it and then I found to my amazement  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=201) that's probably it is possible to  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=206) condense all of TLC not to one sentence  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=210) but to one world of course after they  
[0:03:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=215) took me months to prove that yes from  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=217) this word directly every although still  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=219) see is coming out but the thing that was  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=222) amazing to me as well not that only all  
[0:03:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=225) of this is coming out but what came for  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=228) the first time so clear in my mind is  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=232) that all the evolution of GOC came out  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=237) one-to-one in other words the evolution  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=240) of TOC is not done by fluke there is  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=243) only one way it can evolve and that's  
[0:04:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=245) how it evolved and it's all coming from  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=248) the base of TC which is only one world  
[0:04:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=253) can anybody a guess the world a when  
[0:04:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=258) I've asked the same question in Latin  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=262) America just a month ago  
[0:04:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=264) Alejandro one of the real world you see  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=268) expert I've answered emails and the  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=271) answer is oh  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=273) but this is two words not one I think  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=280) that the world that encompass all of  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=283) this is that you can derive and that's  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=285) what I will try to do in the next three  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=287) hours that you can derive all of TLC  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=290) from it is the world that will not come  
[0:04:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=292) as any surprise to you the world focus  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=294) and everything comes from that so let's  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=299) go about it systematically do you mind  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=301) hello is it ok fine first of all you go  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=308) to the dictionary to find the definition  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=310) of the word focus and don't be shocked  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=312) hey you find about 20 definitions and  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=316) most of them totally unrelated to what  
[0:05:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=319) you had in your mind about focus it's  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=322) more relating to geometry into physics  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=325) of what the meaning of focusing rays and  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=327) so on so let me start with suggesting a  
[0:05:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=332) definition that at least for me is  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=333) intuitive and I think that most people  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=336) at least in the UC community when they  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=338) talk about focus they really mean a what  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=343) is said here and the choice that I had  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=348) for this world the definition that the  
[0:05:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=350) head was focus do what should be done  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=358) let's focus intuitively it's quite  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=362) understandable fine wait why is it so  
[0:06:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=368) difficult just so many things that  
[0:06:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=373) should be done so do not what Soprano  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=376) focusing oh yes you may say that yes  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=380) because there's so many beneficial  
[0:06:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=382) things that we can take we simply don't  
[0:06:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=386) have enough time or enough money or  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=389) enough resources to do them all but then  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=393) the guideline will be the more the  
[0:06:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=395) better so what what is a real  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=399) actually I think that the real meaning  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=405) of the word focus appeared about 200  
[0:06:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=411) years ago because of the work of a  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=414) person called Pareto we all know the  
[0:06:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=417) Pareto principle okay the 80/20 rule if  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=422) you want 80% of the impact is coming  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=426) from just 20% of the elements like for  
[0:07:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=428) example if you are looking on a the  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=432) total population of the country you will  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=435) find out that 20% of the a of the  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=441) collector points a contribute sorry  
[0:07:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=447) 20% of the points contribute to 80% of  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=450) the population or if you look on your  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=452) own business you find out that 20% of  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=454) your clients are contributing 80% of  
[0:07:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=457) your income what does it mean  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=460) immediately if the rule is actually that  
[0:07:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=463) if we look at reality we find out that  
[0:07:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=466) 20% of the all repeal of the elements  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=469) contribute 80% of the impact this means  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=476) that you cannot arbitrarily choose what  
[0:07:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=479) should be done because if you have  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=482) chosen to 80% rather than the 20% the  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=485) difference in performance is humongous  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=488) it's factor of five or even more because  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=491) inside the 20% also you have this error  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=495) key so focusing becomes not a triviality  
[0:08:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=499) how do you find what you really you  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=503) should work on if you want to get more  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=505) of the impact the amazing thing is that  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=511) people agree nolde what Pareto himself  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=516) was highlighting and Perret himself  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=521) bother to say the 20 80% rule is correct  
[0:08:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=527) only when the  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=531) elements are not dependent on each other  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=535) but when you have Intel dependencies the  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=540) situation becomes more extreme teams  
[0:09:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=545) have wrote it and somehow we ignore it  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=547) because let's face it if you are really  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=549) looking into it you'll find out that the  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=552) more interdependencies and by the way  
[0:09:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=555) the more variability the more extreme  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=559) the situation becomes now in  
[0:09:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=561) organizations do you agree with me that  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=563) there are immense amount of  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=566) interdependencies it's unbelievable the  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=570) number of inter dependencies inside an  
[0:09:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=572) organization and at the same time the  
[0:09:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=574) variability is not exactly small it's  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=576) very high which means that if we will  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=580) use Pareto vocabulary we will get  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=584) something like the number of elements  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=589) that really dictate most of the  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=592) contribution is extremely small the  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=594) constraint we're using the a Pareto  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=599) print a vocabulary will get something  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=601) like 0.1% of the elements are  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=606) responsible for 99.9% of the impact now  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=611) focusing becomes totally different is it  
[0:10:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=615) understood so far hello now it's not a  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=622) trivial T anymore but before we go on I  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=625) want to stress the point first of all  
[0:10:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=627) this a a knowledge that if you are  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=631) dealing with the system of  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=632) interdependencies the number of  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=634) constraints is very very small is a  
[0:10:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=636) knowledge that was a research in depth  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=641) in physics in the 19th century anyone  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=645) that knows a little bit about physics  
[0:10:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=647) know the name lagrange when he you spent  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=650) all his life on it showing what the  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=652) meaning of it of to what extent the  
[0:10:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=654) number of constraints are small in a  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=658) interdependent system  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=660) the first of all let me clarify some  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=663) huge mistakes that until today I find  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=666) out that people are making which is they  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=670) mean is that you understand that we are  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=672) dealing with organizations or systems  
[0:11:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=675) which contains a lot of  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=676) interdependencies and variability you  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=679) understand that the number of  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=680) constraints is very very small and  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=682) immediately comes the new vocabulary  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=684) which is constrained to non constraints  
[0:11:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=687) or if I'm going back to the origin of  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=691) TLC in the first five years minimum the  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=694) whole world of TLC was just production  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=696) so the word that I've used the end was  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=698) not constrained even though that's where  
[0:11:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=700) the grand Jeff used I was using the word  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=704) bottleneck enormous link which is  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=707) correct for operation what I found out  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=711) to my amazement from the minute ago and  
[0:11:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=714) even today that people equate non  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=718) constraints or non bottlenecks as equal  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=722) to non important this is a huge stake  
[0:12:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=728) that will lead you directly into the  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=731) wall we do knowledge design dependencies  
[0:12:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=735) interdependencies what does it mean  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=737) immediately it means that if you will  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=739) ignore em non constraint and on  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=742) bottleneck through the independent err  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=744) dependencies with the bottleneck you  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=746) might impact the constraint to the  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=750) extent that the whole performance of the  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=753) whole system goes down to basically zero  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=755) so what do you mean that it's not  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=758) important  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=759) non constraints are very important and  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=762) you cannot ignore them the difference  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=766) between constraint in law and non  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=768) consent is different is is something  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=770) else which is the prevailing notion that  
[0:12:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=775) Steel's override almost all of us all  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=778) the time is that more is better if you  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=781) see an action that is beneficial more is  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=784) better this is correct only for the  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=788) bottlenecks for the constraints for the  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=791) non constraints  
[0:13:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=793) there is some threshold that until this  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=797) threshold more is better but when you  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=800) cross this threshold more becomes worse  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=804) not better  
[0:13:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=807) this red roll itself is determined by  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=812) the interdependencies between the non  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=814) constraint and the constraint and  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=816) because of it there is no way to find  
[0:13:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=820) what is this unbelievably important  
[0:13:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=822) threshold when you are looking on the  
[0:13:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=825) non constraint in isolation and here you  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=829) see immediately the obvious limitation  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=833) which says for the vast majority of the  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=837) system which is the non constraints  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=839) local optima is not equal to the global  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=844) Optima in other words if you look just  
[0:14:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=847) on the non constraint and he will do  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=849) more is better then you will not get  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=851) better results of the whole system you  
[0:14:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=853) might get much worse result of the  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=855) system you see how it is immediate  
[0:14:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=857) derivation yes or no hello fine but now  
[0:14:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=866) continuing to think it look what must  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=868) happen this seal as we said the  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=871) prevailing notion is that when you see  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=874) an action that is beneficial then you  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=877) almost instinctively think that more is  
[0:14:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=880) better as long as this is a prevailing  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=883) notion and as long as vast majority of  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=886) the elements of the system unknown  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=888) constraint what must be the reality and  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=894) you start to see what it is what is now  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=897) number one reason for not doing what  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=899) should be done it's doing what shouldn't  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=902) be done don't you realize that the  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=906) minute that we realize that we have to  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=909) redefine focus more narrowly so very  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=914) early on the definition of focus became  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=917) do what should be done and don't do what  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=923) should not be done hello  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=926) now we are somewhere around 79 obvious  
[0:15:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=935) sofa now look what's happening okay you  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=939) start to work according to that rules  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=943) and what do you find very very quickly  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=947) you find out that in reality in  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=950) organization there is some holy system  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=957) called cost accounting that really  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=961) dictate some measurements and according  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=964) to cost accounting then in 1980 was  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=968) totally holy nobody dare to doubt it  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=971) even a going to cost accounting if you  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=975) produce more you are absorbing more cost  
[0:16:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=983) in the inventory and if you absorb more  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=987) cost in the inventory  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=989) according to cost accounting you have  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=992) increased your profit and lo everybody  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=995) knows it if not going there is cost  
[0:16:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=998) accounting waste your time learning cost  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1000) accounting no it's not waste of time you  
[0:16:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1003) have to know the enemy so look what we  
[0:16:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1006) are saying what we see what we see is  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1009) that cost accounting promotes some type  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1013) of actions promotes more even on non  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1020) bottlenecks even when it's above the  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1023) threshold which is totally crazy no  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1028) wonder that even with the first  
[0:17:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1030) implementations of TOC we clashed  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1033) directly with cost accounting what do  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1036) you do now one way is to give up the  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1041) other way is you start to examine cost  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1044) accounting you start understand where  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1046) the hell this idiotic notion came from  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1049) and then you find out that the people  
[0:17:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1051) who invented cost accounting we're not  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1054) at the same time that Moses was born and  
[0:17:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1058) the  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1059) cost accounting rules were not given on  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1061) Mount Sinai and that actually was  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1064) formulated at the beginning of the 20th  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1066) century and then you find the original  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1069) articles and you find to your amazement  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1072) that the people invented cost accounting  
[0:17:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1074) you exactly what they're doing and  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1076) they're putting all the warnings and  
[0:17:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1078) nobody pays attention anymore to what  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1080) they wrote and basically if you read the  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1089) original articles you see that they gave  
[0:18:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1092) all the warnings of the fact that cost  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1095) accounting is an approximation and they  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1099) say when the approximation will break  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1102) and all our conditions are exactly what  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1105) they wound us and they said explicitly  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1108) if these approximate if these conditions  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1112) are changing too and they had the the  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1116) vision to see that it will change then  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1118) don't even dare to use what we are  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1120) suggesting here and nobody pays  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1123) attention anyhow what wasn't it it is  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1127) not just to do that but what was needed  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1129) is to find a replacement and that was  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1133) not exactly easy because cost accounting  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1138) growingly is used what you in order to  
[0:19:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1143) answer a question which is what should  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1146) be the price of our product and that's  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1152) where they invented this artificial a  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1156) notion which is called product cost  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1160) ladies and gentleman produções does not  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1162) exist in reality cost of an organization  
[0:19:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1165) exists do you have you ever seen a  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1170) product that has a bank account product  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1174) cost is a mathematical invention that at  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1180) the time was very powerful but then when  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1182) you start to say so fine how will I know  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1184) what price should I determine for my  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1187) product and then the answer is you don't  
[0:19:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1192) and it has nothing to do with your cost  
[0:19:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1195) because as you know very well there is  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1198) no one price for the product there is a  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1201) dependency between the price that you  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1204) want to charge for your product and the  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1206) quantity that you will sell am i right  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1209) yes or no it's a kill there is no one  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1213) single answer there and more than that  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1216) for Evans sake or just open your eyes  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1218) and how this is determined the price of  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1222) the product for that go to economy and  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1225) you will find one of the basic rules of  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1227) economy which is called the interplay  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1230) between supply and demand and if you  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1232) notice in the interplay between supply  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1234) and demand your course does not appear  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1238) so what is this nonsense oh yes I need  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1242) cost accounting for something else which  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1244) is how to make decisions like for  
[0:20:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1246) example how to judge whether or not we  
[0:20:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1250) should buy a new machine or how do I  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1256) judge on questions all make versus buy  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1260) there are a whole slew of questions but  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1263) then when you really look on cost  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1265) accounting you'll find out that because  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1267) of the realizations that are concerned  
[0:21:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1270) an unconstrained cost accounting in the  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1273) vast majority of cases will give you the  
[0:21:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1275) wrong answer so what's the alternative  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1278) I know it's called activity-based  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1280) costing this was invented by a very good  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1283) friend of mine Bob Kaplan and I think  
[0:21:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1286) that we already agree that  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1288) activity-based costing is a very very  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1291) elaborated way to get different wrong  
[0:21:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1295) answers and the answer is so simple  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1301) basically we need an alternative in  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1303) order to get to know how to make all  
[0:21:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1306) these decisions not in order to get  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1308) product cost because this is simply not  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1312) the right question at all and because of  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1316) it already in 81 the formalization of  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1320) there  
[0:22:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1321) turn ative came up this is called  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1324) throughput accounting today and this is  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1326) basically the alternative of okay let's  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1330) define throughput operating spends and  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1334) inventory or investment and through that  
[0:22:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1338) we can get easily the answer to all  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1341) these questions what we need is simply  
[0:22:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1343) to find out what is the impact of a  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1347) decision on TI noa support inventory  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1351) operating expense and then the delta  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1354) throughput minus delta operating expense  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1356) is net profit the impact on net profit  
[0:22:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1358) and the delta throughput minus Delta Y  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1361) divided by Delta investment is the  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1363) impact on return investment and here  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1365) they aren't so straightforward no  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1367) problem so if you noticed because of the  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1374) world focuses they need for focus them  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1376) because we acknowledge that reality is  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1381) containing interdependencies and it does  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1384) contain a high level of variability the  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1388) immediate result became what they need  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1392) to find an alternative for cost  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1394) accounting so we starting with  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1396) production all of a sudden I find myself  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1397) in accounting not because I wanted to  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1399) but because otherwise we cannot  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1401) implement the correct actions in  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1403) production because the measurements  
[0:23:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1405) condemned it is it understood yes or no  
[0:23:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1409) fine now what happened is a very  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1414) exciting times where more and more it  
[0:23:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1418) becomes understood and it was developed  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1423) into practical rules of what is the  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1426) meaning of focus remember focus has now  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1430) two different a-pillars one is to do  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1435) what is supposed to be done and the  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1438) other one is not to do what you suppose  
[0:24:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1440) not to be done now if you look on the  
[0:24:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1442) first one the realization of constraints  
[0:24:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1446) and non constraints or bottlenecks and  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1447) non bottlenecks brought up a whole list  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1451) of actions  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1454) that previously will beamed as  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1458) ineffective or inefficient and now all  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1461) of a sudden became clear that these are  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1465) the most important things to do so what  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1468) should be done took a totally new  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1472) meaning let me give you an example do  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1476) you mind  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1476) hello even though I'm back to 8281  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1483) for example a real case eh there is a  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1489) new more effective way to kill people  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1493) it's called a new type of bombs bombs  
[0:24:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1498) that are dropped from an aeroplane and  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1499) then about half a kilometer above the  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1502) ground are splitted into hundreds of  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1505) bomb blasts  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1506) so you destroy a whole area very  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1509) beneficial by the way to solve this  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1514) problem we have to go much much deeper  
[0:25:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1515) ok anyhow the Israeli DoD decide that we  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1522) need this weapon  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1523) so they commissioned tasks which is a  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1526) large company in Israel which produces  
[0:25:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1529) ammunition and they finances the huge  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1534) line to produce these bullets very  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1537) expensive line it's super ultra  
[0:25:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1540) automated machines very very big and  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1544) this line is operational and we start to  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1547) produce bomb blades and not surprising  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1550) is not producing at the level that was  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1553) designed so one month after the other  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1557) they are falling more and more and more  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1560) behind visually do they become so  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1563) concerned that they threatened that they  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1567) will take back the order and they will  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1570) give it to a German manufacturer you are  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1574) not Israeli so you don't know how big is  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1577) this insult moving to the Americans fine  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1581) but to the Germans  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1586) at that time one of the toc people came  
[0:26:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1589) to this plant  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1593) visited the line and then he finds out  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1597) something which is not a big surprise  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1599) which is the line is working is  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1602) activated three shifts a day of course  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1605) but what happened when the shifts are  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1608) changing first of all the people who  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1612) worked on the line are going to have a  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1616) shower they change clothes then they go  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1620) outside they are waiting for the buses  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1622) that brings the the replacement shift to  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1626) come so they can go home the people who  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1629) came with these buses are now eating  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1631) first and then they change clothes and  
[0:27:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1635) then they mend the line so on average  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1638) every time there is a shift change 3/4  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1642) of an hour is lost big day no huge deal  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1647) so you analyze the line it's very easy  
[0:27:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1650) to find out where is the bottleneck of  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1652) the line as a matter of fact every  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1654) person not every manager but every  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1657) person that works on the line knows very  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1658) well where the bottleneck is and this  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1661) bottleneck is a very complicated machine  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1663) that is meant by three people and the  
[0:27:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1666) idea is very simple of course these  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1670) three people should continue to activate  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1672) this machine until the replacement have  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1676) already eaten and change clothes they  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1679) are coming and replacing them so the  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1682) Machine does not stop for one second now  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1685) these people that have just been  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1687) relieved can go and shower and change  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1689) clothes and go home by the way three  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1693) quarters of an hour each shift this  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1695) means about 10 percent more that was  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1697) about the gap what was the answer when  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1702) it was suggested such a triviality how  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1705) are we going to get home the buses have  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1708) already left  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1710) ah get a taxi wait a minute  
[0:28:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1719) depends on the shift they might be three  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1722) people might live in three different  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1724) places get three taxes do you know how  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1729) much you call a taxi cost and I would  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1733) forget it idiotic idea there was no  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1736) choice but to do the calculations with  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1740) them very easy to know how much a taxi  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1742) cost how much non taxi cost in other  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1747) words how much it costs this company if  
[0:29:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1750) they do not get the taxes for these  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1754) three people each shift and as I came  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1756) out very straightforward and each day  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1760) they could have bought the taxi plus the  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1764) white license to operate the taxi each  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1767) date that's how much non Texa cost you  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1772) all to see here in all there were people  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1774) so you know how but that's what I meant  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1776) by that the actions should be taken to a  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1783) totaling you mimic things that will deem  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1786) this totally inefficient before what do  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1788) you want where and sake it costs so much  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1790) the taxi and now as the most important  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1794) single actions that you have to take  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1796) much more than anything else a biggest  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1799) change have happened within known  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1802) constraints remember the run constraints  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1805) and run bottlenecks here you are dealing  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1807) with the problems that internal  
[0:30:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1809) constraint has a different threshold  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1811) that if you are below it you are not  
[0:30:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1814) doing enough and you are above it you  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1815) are doing too much so the problem was  
[0:30:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1820) and very early on it was obvious it's  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1823) totally impractical to monitor and  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1826) control each non constraint separately  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1829) you have to put a mechanism in place  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1830) that in one shot or two fronts tell how  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1835) much each one should work and when to  
[0:30:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1837) stop to work okay  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1840) actually when you look on it the second  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1844) the latter part of focusing what should  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1846) not be done was even more tantalizing  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1850) because all of a sudden you're coming  
[0:30:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1853) into the world of efficiency and you say  
[0:30:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1857) to people don't work so what should we  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1861) do  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1862) stay oh can we do something else now  
[0:31:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1865) stay because who knows maybe in the next  
[0:31:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1868) second you'll be vital that you'll be  
[0:31:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1870) here you say Idol my god what a  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1873) tantalizing thank God that at that time  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1876) and I'm now talking about early 80s  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1879) already two other things were known one  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1883) was very well known which is assembly  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1885) lines in assembly line you have limited  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1889) space between each two work centers and  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1891) when the space or the conveyor belt is  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1893) full nobody regards a worker on assembly  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1897) lines that continue to assemble and drop  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1899) things on the floor as efficient so when  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1902) the conveyor belt after you is full you  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1904) must stop until when until it's helpful  
[0:31:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1906) until there is some space but this is  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1910) different  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1910) in what sense is it different because  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1912) it's simpler so if it works in simple  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1914) cases it means that it will not work for  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1916) you  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1916) nevermind what really saved the day is  
[0:32:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1920) just in time I'm talking about the work  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1925) of Katie on how many of you have heard  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1929) about ATO raise your hand not enough pay  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1934) Triana is one of the greatest thinkers  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1936) in industry all times that's the one who  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1940) invented the Toyota Production system  
[0:32:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1942) he took it much further than Henry Ford  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1945) and yes the same thing when you don't  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1948) have a Kanban card what I is supposed to  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1951) do nothing can I do something else no  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1955) wait same thing of course  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1969) all this knowledge was captured in 83  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1975) and published in January of 84 in the  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1980) book the goal including all the more  
[0:33:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1985) specialized rules of how do you go about  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1988) quality and how to go about breaks and  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1991) how to go and all of that both on this  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1995) huge changing what should be done and  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=1997) the much bigger change of what should  
[0:33:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2000) not be done and then a year later in the  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2005) race  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2006) it was the concepts were written very  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2011) precisely the concepts of serpent  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2013) inventory operating spends and why this  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2015) is a full replacement for cost  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2017) accounting including the concepts of the  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2020) drum buff rope of how to monitor  
[0:33:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2024) according to the constraints and non  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2026) constraints so you don't have to spend  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2028) time individually on each one constraint  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2030) to remember if you do that you have lost  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2032) because this reg hold is different for  
[0:33:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2035) external constraint not just that but  
[0:33:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2037) it's different in time as time goes by  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2040) and I'm talking about even hours this  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2042) threshold may change but more  
[0:34:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2044) importantly a the measurement system was  
[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2050) put in place because now you still have  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2052) still to address the meaning of focus  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2055) which is if you have more than one  
[0:34:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2057) things that you should do what you do  
[0:34:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2060) first which is basically still focus and  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2063) all buffer management in the three color  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2066) code of the priority was invented and  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2068) formulated in the race this brings us to  
[0:34:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2072) 85 still more than twenty years ago  
[0:34:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2087) what happened then is that by the way  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2094) I'm interested in all of that or I'm  
[0:34:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2096) just wasting your time I'm asking are  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2103) you interested in all sizes I don't know  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2109) because what I'm talking about is two  
[0:35:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2110) realities of course  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2111) and besides anyhow nobody listens so why  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2116) shouldn't I continue okay hey what  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2125) happened then is that the results that  
[0:35:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2131) were achieved in more and more and more  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2133) and more production environments and the  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2136) simplicity of the logic and the speed  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2139) was so encouraging that other  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2142) environments started to ask for the same  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2148) and started to mimic it and operational  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2152) environments within operation a you know  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2157) the first attempts were not exactly very  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2159) good because there is a famous rule that  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2162) says that if you are good with a hammer  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2165) everything looks to you like a nail that  
[0:36:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2169) was ruling the whole environment I have  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2173) started to go out of my way really being  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2178) very unhappy with what my own people and  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2180) people that have learned for me have  
[0:36:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2182) done and I said don't you realize for  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2184) heaven's sake that you are dealing here  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2186) with different environment environments  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2189) which are different to the extent that  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2191) if you are simply copying from  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2194) production you're doing mistakes and to  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2196) what extent it's different it's  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2199) different to the extent that the  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2201) constraint the nature of constraint  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2204) itself is different for example at that  
[0:36:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2207) time constraint and bottleneck was  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2210) synonymous as a matter of fact everybody  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2212) was using the word bottleneck the wealth  
[0:36:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2214) constraint was not used at all but  
[0:36:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2216) you're coming to another environment  
[0:36:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2218) like an operational environment that  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2220) instead of producing the same product  
[0:37:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2223) again again again it's environmental  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2225) projects don't you realize that the  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2230) meaning of constraint is different as a  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2233) matter of fact it was already in 1903  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2238) published the first real article that  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2242) shows how to focus in projects what do I  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2245) mean look if you are looking on a pet of  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2249) a project okay then I'm talked about not  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2254) a tiny project but something average you  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2259) are talking about and when you look on  
[0:37:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2261) these birds nothing about at least 5,000  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2263) different tasks as a matter of fact our  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2266) projects we is fifty thousand okay three  
[0:37:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2269) thousand different tasks what you have  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2270) to do everything what's the meaning of  
[0:37:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2272) focus here and here comes a genius who  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2275) invented the concept of critical path  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2280) look what the meaning of it is said the  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2283) things that really dictate the  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2284) performance and if you were talking  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2286) about is a time to complete the project  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2288) is not determined by all the three  
[0:38:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2291) thousand tasks just look on it there is  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2293) one path which is the critical path  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2297) which contains maybe 20 tasks that's all  
[0:38:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2300) they are the one that dictates the holy  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2302) time that it so focus on that every note  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2308) is the same concept but look what the  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2310) meaning of it it means as a constraint  
[0:38:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2311) in project has nothing to do with  
[0:38:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2314) bottlenecks it is a critical path and  
[0:38:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2316) when you are thinking little bit more  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2318) when you go back to the original  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2321) definition of critical path whether it's  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2324) amazing to what extent the people who  
[0:38:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2326) put the original things where had the  
[0:38:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2329) fantastic insight but then the followers  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2332) of their students have simplified it and  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2334) doomed us to huge mistakes you are  
[0:38:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2337) looking on the original definition of  
[0:38:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2339) critical path and it is defined as the  
[0:39:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2342) longest chain of tasks and  
[0:39:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2348) what is the longest path which are  
[0:39:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2350) dependent on each other what are the two  
[0:39:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2352) types of dependencies one is a structure  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2355) dependencies the other one is resource  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2357) dependency and if you follow that you  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2360) don't get critical paths you get  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2362) critical chain which is the original  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2365) idea so I'm not taking any credit for  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2367) this idea but you understand that all of  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2371) the sudden the concept of the constraint  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2375) have changed it was nothing to do with  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2377) bottleneck it is the critical path it's  
[0:39:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2381) time all of a sudden and then when we  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2385) went into distribution environments you  
[0:39:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2388) find out that the constraint has nothing  
[0:39:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2391) to do with bottlenecks whatsoever it has  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2393) nothing to do with capacity in  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2395) distribution the constraint depends on  
[0:39:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2398) which environment you are if you are in  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2400) retail excuse me if you are in  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2403) wholesalers distributors the constraint  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2405) is definitely cash if you're in retail  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2407) the constraint is the number of clients  
[0:40:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2410) that are entering your shop nothing to  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2413) do with capacity and here is the same  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2416) thing since what the constraint what for  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2418) example all the production they need to  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2423) eliminate overproduction which means the  
[0:40:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2425) idea of a threshold in project in  
[0:40:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2428) production when you are looking in  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2431) projects it becomes totally different it  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2433) is they need not to buffer with most  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2436) Safety's individual tasks and if you are  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2439) looking the distribution it translates  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2441) over production translates into don't  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2443) sheep ahead of time rather than don't  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2446) produce ahead of time hold it back okay  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2448) but then what happened is it became talk  
[0:40:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2451) so apparent that the world bottleneck is  
[0:40:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2453) misleading so we had to replace it and  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2455) we replaced it with the word constraint  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2458) but also they need to now clearly  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2464) verbalize the focusing process was  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2466) screaming hell and that's why at that  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2469) time the five focusing steps was the  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2472) first time verbalized identify the  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2474) constraint decide how to exploit the  
[0:41:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2478) constraint subordinate everything else  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2480) to the above this  
[0:41:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2482) this was formulated in 87 and if you  
[0:41:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2486) take the original two versions of the  
[0:41:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2489) goal the one from 84 and then the one  
[0:41:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2492) from 86 you will not find any mention of  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2496) these five focusing steps so in 87 that  
[0:41:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2501) was the time that the world Theory of  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2502) Constraints was coined and that's where  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2505) the time that together with it the five  
[0:41:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2508) focusing steps have been formulated and  
[0:41:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2511) released everything looks nice and then  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2515) the now what is was the immediate next  
[0:42:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2520) challenge even notice this happened not  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2522) because of failures but because the  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2525) knowledge was so powerful in so  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2527) successful new horizons have opened new  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2531) questions have open and because of it  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2533) new knowledge had to be created what was  
[0:42:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2537) the next step after that well the five  
[0:42:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2541) focusing step has opened the Pandora box  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2544) basically  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2544) so many other environments non  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2548) operational environments I'm not talking  
[0:42:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2551) anymore on operations like production or  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2553) project management or distribution I'm  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2555) talking about other type of environment  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2557) I've said whoops this applies to us  
[0:42:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2561) they've started to use the five focusing  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2564) steps and very clearly it became  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2568) apparent that a whole body of knowledge  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2572) is missing because what were the  
[0:42:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2576) questions then in the center stage how  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2578) do you identify the constraint fine you  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2581) identified it how you decide how to  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2584) exploit it you've done that how do you  
[0:43:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2588) put the mechanism of subordination how  
[0:43:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2590) do you put the mechanism for elevation  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2593) these were new questions in new  
[0:43:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2594) environments and I found myself in  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2598) almost a Leland in what sense  
[0:43:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2602) usually what do you do when you have  
[0:43:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2604) such a question you go and find out who  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2607) is the best practice who is doing the  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2608) best you look what he's done or what is  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2611) doing and that usually gives you the  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2613) answer when you come  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2615) with these type of questions or for  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2616) example how do you decide how to exploit  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2619) the constraint and you go through the  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2621) best places and you look what they are  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2622) doing and you find out that they are  
[0:43:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2624) doing almost the same with the optic  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2626) things when you look on how this is  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2629) subordinate and you really look on the  
[0:43:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2630) best ones and you see to what extent the  
[0:43:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2632) best ones are still very bad you cannot  
[0:43:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2634) get the answers so what is left  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2637) intuition oh my god I started to feel  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2640) that I am trembling first of all it  
[0:44:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2643) takes time to develop intuition in other  
[0:44:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2645) environments the other thing is that  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2648) still everyone is taking what we have  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2653) done in this previous environment it  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2655) copied one to one even though it doesn't  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2657) fit at all the problem was and that was  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2662) the amazing thing that when you are  
[0:44:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2664) looking on the best ways to find answers  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2669) you find out that this best way is far  
[0:44:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2672) from being sufficient what was the best  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2674) way at that time still is you first of  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2679) all acknowledge reality as is you are  
[0:44:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2683) looking courageously at gaps between the  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2688) current situation and what you want it  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2692) to be in other words you are looking on  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2695) problems then you don't go blindly you  
[0:44:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2699) are doing an attempt to quantify the  
[0:45:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2702) impact of each problem many times you  
[0:45:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2704) find out it's very hard to quantify but  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2706) please get an order of magnitude and  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2708) then you use the Google Pareto you are  
[0:45:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2713) putting the biggest problem in terms of  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2714) impact at the top and then you take the  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2716) first three or four from this list and  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2719) you work on that what is the problem  
[0:45:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2722) here conceptual mistake if you notice  
[0:45:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2726) the assumption here is still that the  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2729) gaps these problems are not dependent  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2733) and when you are really acknowledging  
[0:45:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2738) reality and you start to take the  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2741) interdependencies into account and you  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2743) do even the first rude analysis you find  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2746) out something that  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2747) Newton was warning us a long time ago  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2750) which is what you call problems are  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2755) actually just effects of a much deeper  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2759) cause in what sense is deeper if you  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2762) take into account interdependencies you  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2765) will find out to what extent there is  
[0:46:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2767) because that caused all these  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2769) undesirable effects and these problems  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2771) are nothing but effects of this deeper  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2774) cause undesirable effects but then the  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2777) real bewilderment start when you notice  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2780) that once you identify the core problem  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2783) you start to realize that most of the  
[0:46:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2787) recommendations given by prudent people  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2791) that were given when you look on a  
[0:46:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2794) problem in isolation on unvisible effect  
[0:46:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2797) in isolation most of the recommendations  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2800) when you now acknowledge the core  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2802) problem you find out that they're  
[0:46:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2806) definitely much less effective in terms  
[0:46:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2809) of the impact but many many times you  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2812) find out that the wrong actions in other  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2814) words the answers that you get when you  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2817) look on each OD separately the answers  
[0:47:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2820) that you get in terms what to in terms  
[0:47:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2822) of what to do when you do the full  
[0:47:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2824) analysis many times it turned out that  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2825) it belongs to exactly the opposite group  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2828) it's something that you shouldn't do in  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2831) other words a systematic way to do what  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2835) how to answer the questions of identify  
[0:47:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2838) the constraint how to answer the  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2840) questions of how to decide on exploiting  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2842) it how to answer the questions of how to  
[0:47:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2845) subordinate and so what what is  
[0:47:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2847) systematic way to go about it and it was  
[0:47:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2851) obvious that nothing that exists there  
[0:47:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2853) it works except for something that was  
[0:47:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2856) existing in a long long time since their  
[0:47:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2859) Isaac Newton which is a scientific  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2860) approach unfortunately nobody verbalized  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2863) it three years of real collaborative  
[0:47:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2870) effort to formulate what is now known as  
[0:47:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2873) the thinking processes basically how do  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2879) you go systematically about finding the  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2881) core problem how do you find a solution  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2886) which is not a compromise and how do you  
[0:48:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2889) trim away that and ensure that this  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2892) solution will not generate new on  
[0:48:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2894) disable these are the thinking processes  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2897) by the way very interesting in parallel  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2901) the same problem was recognized into  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2904) yatta and one of three pillars in toyota  
[0:48:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2910) is something called the five why's what  
[0:48:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2915) is the meaning of the five why's you see  
[0:48:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2918) a problem to say one way is to deal with  
[0:48:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2922) the cause of what the immediate cause of  
[0:48:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2924) this problem forget it you will stop  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2926) there most likely what you'll do will  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2928) hurt much help you have to continue to  
[0:48:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2931) ask why minimum five times in order to  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2935) reach the vicinity of the core problem  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2938) and if you talk with two other people  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2941) like I'm doing very much in the last  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2943) year and a half you'll find out that  
[0:49:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2945) they said for Evan sakes there is so  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2948) much charlatanism there because to  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2952) answer the first one is very easy to  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2954) answer the second y is not so difficult  
[0:49:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2958) to answer the third y is a real problem  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2961) and all the people that have been really  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2964) trained for a long time are able to  
[0:49:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2967) answer the fifth why and god forbid that  
[0:49:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2969) you will stop before that by the way you  
[0:49:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2972) know it very well from your own  
[0:49:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2974) experience almost all of you came across  
[0:49:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2976) a four year old kid  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2978) what is a most popular question of a  
[0:49:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2981) four year old kid why and usually ask  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2986) why and you don't have any problem to  
[0:49:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2988) answer unfortunately or fortunately what  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2992) is the kid doing immediately why that he  
[0:49:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2995) is doing the second why automatically  
[0:49:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=2997) and then it's not so easy to answer  
[0:50:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3000) but you answer and then immediately the  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3003) third y and then you say go to your  
[0:50:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3005) mother  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3007) just use that and see how them  
[0:50:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3010) difficulties to answer five wires by the  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3012) way now that we have developed thinking  
[0:50:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3014) processes then we have something called  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3015) the current reality tree which is making  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3018) this job of the going diving down so  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3021) much easier because it's very hard to  
[0:50:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3024) dive down for one undesirable effect it  
[0:50:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3027) turns out that it is very far easier to  
[0:50:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3029) dive down from many undesirable effects  
[0:50:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3032) hello  
[0:50:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3033) one problem is too difficult take five  
[0:50:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3035) it's easier have you notice it it's so  
[0:50:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3039) crazy but that's reality and then when  
[0:50:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3041) you are building the the control tea  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3043) tree you will find out that you almost  
[0:50:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3045) cannot find one single current reality  
[0:50:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3047) tree on any environment where the whole  
[0:50:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3049) problem is not minimum five steps below  
[0:50:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3053) the surface of the undesirable effects  
[0:50:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3055) which means the five why's we're really  
[0:50:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3059) good by the way  
[0:51:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3060) what I found out just last year is  
[0:51:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3063) amazing thing which is you all know that  
[0:51:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3067) taiichi ohno was not the president it  
[0:51:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3070) was a head of production and so a long  
[0:51:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3073) time I suspected that the president must  
[0:51:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3075) have been a real caliber to enable him  
[0:51:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3079) to allow dr. honor to do what you've  
[0:51:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3081) done which was such a department  
[0:51:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3083) departure from convention that at the  
[0:51:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3086) beginning produced bad results not good  
[0:51:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3088) results and to allow him to continue on  
[0:51:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3091) until the results will be there which  
[0:51:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3093) took more than ten years it turned out  
[0:51:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3097) that this boss of tight Rihanna was a  
[0:51:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3101) person called Toyota the founder and the  
[0:51:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3105) one who came up with the five wise was  
[0:51:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3108) not idea no it was to yield himself in  
[0:51:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3111) other words you're not talking about one  
[0:51:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3113) genius that done the revelation you're  
[0:51:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3115) talking about the combination of two  
[0:51:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3116) that were perfectly with each other very  
[0:51:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3119) very rare in history anyhow what  
[0:52:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3124) happened is that in the period of 89 to  
[0:52:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3129) 90 too many people have joined forces in  
[0:52:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3134) order to verbalize and to check and to  
[0:52:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3139) check the thinking  
[0:52:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3140) processes this was a huge step forward  
[0:52:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3144) because now we have the systematic way  
[0:52:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3147) of how to answer the questions that must  
[0:52:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3150) be answered if answered if you want to  
[0:52:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3152) focus and basically on any environment  
[0:52:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3156) this brings us to 92 and at that time I  
[0:52:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3162) started to write about it a I didn't  
[0:52:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3165) felt that it's completed so if you  
[0:52:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3168) notice I've wrote a little bit about the  
[0:52:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3171) thinking process I've never wrote a  
[0:52:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3173) whole book on the thinking processes I'm  
[0:52:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3175) very grateful that others have wrote it  
[0:52:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3178) even though whenever I'm reading this  
[0:53:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3180) book I feel oh here's a mistake and  
[0:53:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3183) here's a mistake but you know what it's  
[0:53:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3185) better than nothing by far bet on  
[0:53:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3186) anything there on Sunday  
[0:53:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3191) those of you will come to listen to me I  
[0:53:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3194) will explain why Dean wrote it there was  
[0:53:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3197) a major part missing that people didn't  
[0:53:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3202) even notice it I felt uncomfortable  
[0:53:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3204) because the news is the picture is not  
[0:53:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3205) finalized I hope that next year it will  
[0:53:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3210) be finalized and then I will write a  
[0:53:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3212) book on the thinking processes the  
[0:53:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3214) concrete book they basically I know how  
[0:53:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3218) what is missing and how to plug of a  
[0:53:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3220) missing hole but this is for Saturday  
[0:53:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3223) what I want to emphasize now is that a  
[0:53:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3229) around that time 91 92 I said we made it  
[0:53:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3235) now we have it never say it  
[0:54:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3240) what happens is that the more powerful  
[0:54:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3243) the solution the more it works the more  
[0:54:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3247) it changes reality and if you just wake  
[0:54:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3250) up and acknowledge reality is is rather  
[0:54:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3254) than as you see it with your previous  
[0:54:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3257) perception you will find out that here  
[0:54:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3261) right in front of you knocking on your  
[0:54:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3263) door  
[0:54:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3264) there are huge new challenges that if  
[0:54:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3268) you don't address them you actually  
[0:54:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3273) violated Bedley the word focus and as  
[0:54:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3277) time goes by you are more and more  
[0:54:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3279) unfocused and this was must bring you  
[0:54:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3282) back to realize what is the new  
[0:54:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3284) challenge now what is the challenge that  
[0:54:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3286) if you don't answer you're totally  
[0:54:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3287) unfocused and of course at that time you  
[0:54:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3290) have to develop new knowledge in order  
[0:54:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3292) to answer it this was a situation  
[0:54:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3295) basically in 91 92 we are now at the  
[0:54:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3299) beginning of the 90s the main work is to  
[0:55:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3305) complete and polish the thinking  
[0:55:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3308) processes but life goes on and more and  
[0:55:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3314) more and more implementations of TLC  
[0:55:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3317) pops everywhere a my friends those of  
[0:55:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3323) you who were not working so hard at that  
[0:55:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3328) time with me or not with me on safe  
[0:55:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3331) constraints let's say something the  
[0:55:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3336) biggest impact in terms of causing  
[0:55:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3339) implementations of TLC was not did not  
[0:55:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3344) came from our direct work it came from  
[0:55:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3348) the book the goal I think that at least  
[0:55:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3352) hundred times more implementations were  
[0:55:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3355) done by the book without any one of us  
[0:55:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3357) involved then implementations that  
[0:56:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3360) involve any one of us just do to  
[0:56:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3364) highlight it I started to get letters  
[0:56:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3368) from readers of this book about six  
[0:56:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3371) months after it was out  
[0:56:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3373) a the letter that I cherish the most was  
[0:56:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3376) less than a year after it was out and it  
[0:56:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3379) was from a an American plant manager any  
[0:56:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3384) wrote to me shows letter I memorized it  
[0:56:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3386) word by word and he said dr. gall that  
[0:56:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3388) your book is not a novel anymore its  
[0:56:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3391) documentary I have done exactly what you  
[0:56:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3395) wrote in the book and I replicated all  
[0:56:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3397) the results and the only difference  
[0:56:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3400) between my book your book and my reality  
[0:56:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3402) is that my wife didn't came back yet  
[0:56:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3410) more and more and more and more  
[0:56:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3413) implementations and I started to realize  
[0:57:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3421) that in the name of focus we have lost  
[0:57:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3429) focus  
[0:57:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3430) what do I mean what you have in the goal  
[0:57:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3436) is the then understanding which is you  
[0:57:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3444) implement it in operations it's worked  
[0:57:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3447) very well as a matter of fact  
[0:57:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3450) surprisingly well but what is happening  
[0:57:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3454) is that very quickly the constraint is  
[0:57:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3460) not in operation anymore it's moving out  
[0:57:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3463) usually to the market and that's what is  
[0:57:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3467) described in the goal itself and then  
[0:57:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3470) you need more orders and what is written  
[0:57:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3472) in the goal is that your superior  
[0:57:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3477) capabilities in operation enables you to  
[0:58:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3481) get more orders the story that is in the  
[0:58:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3486) goal is a real story I don't know how  
[0:58:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3488) many of you know it but the goal is  
[0:58:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3491) based on real stories I took the freedom  
[0:58:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3494) of combining stories of two different of  
[0:58:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3498) three different plans into one one of  
[0:58:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3501) them where I took Alex Rogo denilla  
[0:58:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3505) further in reality a  
[0:58:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3507) is a plant of how much how much turbine  
[0:58:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3511) by the way I just a year ago I got an  
[0:58:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3515) update of it I got a letter from the VP  
[0:58:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3520) of supply chain of the much larger  
[0:58:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3523) companies that have bought home a  
[0:58:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3525) turbine and he wrote to me and said I've  
[0:58:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3530) heard that one of the plants of how much  
[0:58:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3533) turbine was one of the plants that were  
[0:58:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3535) the base of the goal and is it correct  
[0:58:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3538) and I said yes the other two plants are  
[0:59:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3543) one is a client of GE jet engines and  
[0:59:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3547) the other one is a plant of bellows of  
[0:59:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3551) another company but I put it in one  
[0:59:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3554) story this a those of you read the goal  
[0:59:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3560) and believes it most of you did it  
[0:59:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3562) remember the story about this very  
[0:59:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3564) important client that comes to thank and  
[0:59:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3568) to shake hands with every worker in the  
[0:59:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3571) plant because they've saved his day and  
[0:59:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3574) actually none of the workers on the  
[0:59:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3578) foreman knows what he's talking about  
[0:59:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3579) because there was no special effort it  
[0:59:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3581) was a run of the mill a reality is that  
[0:59:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3585) this person was coming with his  
[0:59:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3587) helicopters he was a head of GE  
[0:59:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3590) purchasing and he came to Hamas Tobin to  
[0:59:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3593) thank them for saving their but in the  
[0:59:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3596) blades for the jet engines that's a real  
[1:00:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3600) story why do I tell you all of that  
[1:00:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3604) because yes you can get more orders and  
[1:00:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3608) everybody was happy including me until I  
[1:00:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3612) started to realize when more and more  
[1:00:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3616) and more cases piled up that actually we  
[1:00:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3620) have lost focus totally let me highlight  
[1:00:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3626) it to you because I do believe that even  
[1:00:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3629) though I was trying to deal with this  
[1:00:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3631) problem and tried to shake all of  
[1:00:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3634) you out already since 93 in it's not  
[1:00:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3638) luck i today  
[1:00:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3640) didn't succeed it so let me show you the  
[1:00:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3644) magnitude of the problem and in order to  
[1:00:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3647) show it let me take a case from the this  
[1:00:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3652) decade from 2000 and let me show to what  
[1:00:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3656) extent we do not dare to look in reality  
[1:01:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3661) as is and when we don't have a real good  
[1:01:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3666) answer to a big problem  
[1:01:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3668) we pretend the problem does not exist  
[1:01:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3670) it's part of reality and that ensures  
[1:01:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3673) that we'll never solve it in order to  
[1:01:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3677) show you what I'm talking about I would  
[1:01:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3679) like to read to you a small summary of a  
[1:01:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3684) very well-known company from Japan that  
[1:01:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3687) was gracious enough to put all the  
[1:01:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3691) numbers in the public domain the company  
[1:01:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3694) as a whole is Hitachi a it that she  
[1:01:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3698) never ever gives the PNL the financial  
[1:01:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3703) statement of a division nevertheless in  
[1:01:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3705) this case they have released all the  
[1:01:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3708) numbers so that I can use them let me  
[1:01:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3712) show you what is the case and I will ask  
[1:01:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3714) Wendy that knows how to read much better  
[1:01:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3717) than me Oh Patrick to read it first  
[1:02:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3725) and I'm not going to give her mine she  
[1:02:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3731) will take over what Wendy will read is a  
[1:02:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3735) paragraph form a an article that I  
[1:02:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3739) believe is a cornerstone this article  
[1:02:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3743) was checked by Toyota  
[1:02:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3746) it was totally proved by Toyota as the  
[1:02:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3748) manufacturers have started to move on it  
[1:02:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3750) and I'm talking about all of Toyota so  
[1:02:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3753) if you want a copy of this article just  
[1:02:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3755) ask for it and I think that we put it in  
[1:02:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3758) sub website so we will know somebody  
[1:02:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3761) will figure out how to give access to  
[1:02:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3764) you for this article standing on the  
[1:02:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3769) shoulders of giants  
[1:02:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3772) and we're like by the way who you know  
[1:02:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3775) who said standing on the shoulders of  
[1:02:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3777) giants it's here Sir Isaac Newton and  
[1:03:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3780) the full sentence is the fact that I see  
[1:03:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3784) two such distances is only because I'm  
[1:03:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3787) standing on the shoulders of giants Hey  
[1:03:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3790) which I believe is extremely important  
[1:03:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3793) sentence that if you want to make any  
[1:03:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3795) advance you have to do a festival to  
[1:03:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3797) understand what the Giants before you  
[1:03:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3799) have done so you can't stand on their  
[1:03:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3801) shoulders but the whole idea is that if  
[1:03:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3804) you stand on the shoulders of giants  
[1:03:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3806) your obligation is to see further than  
[1:03:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3809) them if you are not making any attempt  
[1:03:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3811) for that don't bother them don't stand  
[1:03:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3814) on their shoulders send in their shadow  
[1:03:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3816) and the meaning of what is the meaning  
[1:03:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3819) of understanding what the Giants have  
[1:03:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3821) done in order to find how to look  
[1:03:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3823) further that's what I've tried to  
[1:03:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3825) portray here in this article the giant  
[1:03:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3828) that I'm talking about our the two  
[1:03:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3829) phenomenal Giants in industry one is  
[1:03:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3832) Henry Ford and the other one which in my  
[1:03:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3835) eyes is even much bigger is patreon and  
[1:03:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3839) then how to take it further and why and  
[1:04:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3841) how was this done by what they've done  
[1:04:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3844) they've paved the way to go further so  
[1:04:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3847) when you go further it does not mean  
[1:04:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3849) that you diminish their work the exact  
[1:04:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3852) opposite is right this is the highest a  
[1:04:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3857) thank you that you can give to their  
[1:04:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3860) work so here let's go very very down  
[1:04:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3865) into the Hitachi case  
[1:04:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3873) and welcome Wendy please read the  
[1:04:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3876) example of hitachi Itachi tool  
[1:04:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3879) engineering limited a 24 billion yen  
[1:04:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3883) company designs and manufacturers over  
[1:04:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3888) 20,000 different cutting tools  
[1:04:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3891) the demand for most of their products is  
[1:04:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3895) sporadic and the customs of their  
[1:04:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3898) industry force them to launch new  
[1:05:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3901) product families of tools every six  
[1:05:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3905) months when new product families are  
[1:05:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3909) launched the older families become  
[1:05:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3912) obsolete it's no wonder that their  
[1:05:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3915) efforts to implement lean were  
[1:05:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3918) unsuccessful  
[1:05:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3920) by the way they reported the six huge  
[1:05:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3922) attempts to implement lean all of them  
[1:05:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3925) failed even when they've used people  
[1:05:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3928) from tree oughtta to help them to do it  
[1:05:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3931) in other words it was not lack of effort  
[1:05:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3933) or lack of knowledge simply the  
[1:05:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3935) environment is too different to enable  
[1:05:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3938) the mechanism of lean the mistake is not  
[1:05:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3941) to differentiate between the mechanism  
[1:05:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3943) and the concept and if you start from  
[1:05:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3946) the concepts there is a very nice  
[1:05:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3948) application that can propel the company  
[1:05:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3951) into the new heights Hitachi tool  
[1:05:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3956) Engineering limited started implementing  
[1:06:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3960) DBR drum buffer rope in one of their  
[1:06:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3964) four plants in Japan in the year 2000  
[1:06:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3967) the jump in due date performance from 40  
[1:06:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3972) percent to 85 percent that was  
[1:06:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3975) associated with cutting work in process  
[1:06:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3977) and lead times in half along with the  
[1:06:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3982) ability to ship 20% more products with  
[1:06:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3986) the same labor force encouraged them to  
[1:06:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3989) expand their implementation by 2003 they  
[1:06:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=3995) had implemented DBR in all four plans  
[1:06:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4001) the drastic reduction in lead time and  
[1:06:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4004) the  
[1:06:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4005) better responsiveness enabled a  
[1:06:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4008) reduction of inventory in the supply  
[1:06:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4012) chain the distributors from eight to two  
[1:06:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4017) point four months worth the reduction of  
[1:07:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4021) inventory improved dramatically the  
[1:07:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4025) distributor's return on investment it  
[1:07:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4028) freed up their cash and it strengthened  
[1:07:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4032) their relationship with Hitachi  
[1:07:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4035) it's no wonder the distributor's  
[1:07:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4038) expanded the range of Hitachi tools that  
[1:07:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4041) they were offering leading to an  
[1:07:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4044) increase of twenty percent in sales in a  
[1:07:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4048) stable market the true impact is  
[1:07:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4052) revealed when we evaluate this company's  
[1:07:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4055) bottom line performance in light of the  
[1:07:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4058) fact that during the period of 2002 to  
[1:07:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4063) 2007 the price of raw materials metals  
[1:07:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4067) increased much more than the increase in  
[1:07:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4071) the selling price of cutting tools under  
[1:07:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4075) such conditions the profits of the  
[1:07:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4078) company should have vanished  
[1:08:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4081) instead the annual net profit before  
[1:08:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4084) taxes of Hitachi tool engineering  
[1:08:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4087) limited increased from 1.1 billion yen  
[1:08:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4092) in the fiscal year ending March 2002 to  
[1:08:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4097) 5.3 billion yen in the year ending March  
[1:08:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4101) 2007 a five-fold increase in net profit  
[1:08:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4106) in five years the profit ratio of  
[1:08:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4111) Hitachi tool engineering increased from  
[1:08:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4115) 7.2 percent in 2002 to 21 point nine  
[1:08:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4121) percent in 2007 the highest ratio ever  
[1:08:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4125) reported in this type of industry  
[1:08:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4133) nice I can't tell you nice  
[1:08:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4138) everybody that's my problems with you  
[1:09:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4146) because when I read it I said oh  
[1:09:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4151) the fact that they are number one in the  
[1:09:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4155) world should not obliterate the fact  
[1:09:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4158) that this is the opposite of focusing so  
[1:09:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4163) let's look on it again and let's talk a  
[1:09:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4166) little bit more in not just in their  
[1:09:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4169) example but in generic case ladies and  
[1:09:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4173) gentlemen this is a very typical case  
[1:09:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4177) you put you see in operation and with  
[1:09:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4183) depends what you're doing if you don't  
[1:09:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4187) know what you're doing within a year you  
[1:09:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4190) chase the constraint out of operation  
[1:09:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4193) it's in the market if you know what you  
[1:09:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4196) are doing it takes about four weeks and  
[1:09:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4198) the constraint is now in the market ok  
[1:10:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4203) what we don't pay attention is and  
[1:10:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4206) that's my problem there's this  
[1:10:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4210) improvement huge improvement in  
[1:10:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4213) operation not only enables getting some  
[1:10:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4218) more sales but it actually created the  
[1:10:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4226) dream it created a decisive competitive  
[1:10:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4231) edge how many companies you think have a  
[1:10:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4236) decisive competitive edge many companies  
[1:10:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4240) can compete how many have a decisive  
[1:10:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4243) competitive edge to answer that let me  
[1:10:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4245) define more precisely what is decisive  
[1:10:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4248) competitive edge a company that have a  
[1:10:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4252) decisive competitive edge means this  
[1:10:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4255) company is able to satisfy clients  
[1:11:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4261) significant need to an extent that  
[1:11:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4265) nobody else can  
[1:11:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4266) that's a decisive competitive edge  
[1:11:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4270) lately some people started to talk about  
[1:11:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4274) it how many of you are read a very good  
[1:11:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4278) book called blue ocean fine it's an  
[1:11:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4287) excellent book what the two authors  
[1:11:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4290) wrote there was about the fact that most  
[1:11:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4294) companies live in a red ocean an ocean  
[1:11:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4298) which is red from the blood that they  
[1:11:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4301) are releasing to the water because each  
[1:11:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4303) one is biting and eating it the other  
[1:11:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4305) one the concept of blue ocean is you  
[1:11:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4310) curve yourself part of the ocean where  
[1:11:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4313) there is no competitors that's the blue  
[1:11:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4315) ocean and then you're really making it  
[1:11:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4319) the most active thinking about it is  
[1:12:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4321) already you step forward this book shows  
[1:12:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4326) a whole spectrum of examples of  
[1:12:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4331) companies that succeeded to pave a blue  
[1:12:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4335) ocean  
[1:12:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4336) unfortunately the writers are not daring  
[1:12:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4341) enough and because of that all the  
[1:12:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4344) examples that they're using is to find a  
[1:12:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4347) blue ocean outside the red ocean which  
[1:12:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4350) means going and satisfying and you need  
[1:12:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4354) they are honest enough to mention in  
[1:12:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4360) every single case that they're bringing  
[1:12:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4362) of a successful company that actually it  
[1:12:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4365) was not the first company were thinking  
[1:12:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4367) about it  
[1:12:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4368) it is number 50 that were thinking about  
[1:12:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4371) it the first 49 are bankrupt basically  
[1:12:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4376) what is happening is that when you are  
[1:12:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4379) curving yourself a blue ocean by looking  
[1:13:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4382) on in you need first of all you have to  
[1:13:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4386) make sure that that's a real need of the  
[1:13:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4389) market and not your wishful thinking if  
[1:13:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4392) it is a wishful thinking another real  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4395) need  
[1:13:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4395) you will go belly up but even if it is  
[1:13:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4398) in you need don't underestimate how much  
[1:13:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4401) time and effort it takes until you bring  
[1:13:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4404) the market to realize that death and  
[1:13:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4407) need that you really want to be  
[1:13:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4409) satisfied the first 49 companies have  
[1:13:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4413) paid the wave paid it the weigh-in on  
[1:13:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4416) their bones the number 50 succeeded like  
[1:13:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4419) exactly set better books that was built  
[1:13:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4422) on bones of people what we are talking  
[1:13:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4427) about here is that when you are  
[1:13:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4430) improving operation almost in every  
[1:13:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4434) single case almost in every single case  
[1:13:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4437) you create a decisive competitive edge  
[1:14:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4442) within the red ocean itself in other  
[1:14:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4446) words you are all of a sudden being able  
[1:14:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4449) to satisfy a real need of the client a  
[1:14:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4454) recognized need of the client to an  
[1:14:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4458) extent that nobody else can do it which  
[1:14:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4460) means you don't have the problem the  
[1:14:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4462) same magnet of convincing the clients  
[1:14:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4464) that that is need he knows it as a  
[1:14:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4466) matter of fact you have to convince him  
[1:14:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4468) that at last there is somebody who can  
[1:14:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4470) satisfy it because he gave up which is  
[1:14:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4473) much easier job almost in every single  
[1:14:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4482) case the improvement and operation  
[1:14:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4484) creates such a decisive competitive edge  
[1:14:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4487) and people don't pay attention to it let  
[1:14:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4489) me take that as an example let's analyze  
[1:14:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4494) again what we've read here so Wendy can  
[1:14:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4498) you bring it to the beginning of this  
[1:15:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4501) paragraph first of all let's get some  
[1:15:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4509) realization of the size of this company  
[1:15:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4511) we know that go about above the bar  
[1:15:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4517) please okay it's 24 billion yen's which  
[1:15:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4521) means in real money something like 250  
[1:15:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4525) million dollars cutting tools  
[1:15:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4528) how big is you think the total world  
[1:15:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4533) market of cutting tools the year a  
[1:15:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4538) little bit bigger than 250 million  
[1:15:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4541) dollars 10 times bigger minimum more  
[1:15:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4546) which means this company represent a  
[1:15:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4549) relatively small fraction of the world  
[1:15:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4552) consumption they are operating worldwide  
[1:15:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4555) of course fine  
[1:15:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4559) in other the market is huge to whom do  
[1:16:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4564) they sell we all know it they sell to go  
[1:16:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4571) down they sell to distributors  
[1:16:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4579) wholesalers ok these wholesalers if you  
[1:16:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4584) will continue to read it's apparent to  
[1:16:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4587) us that these all sellers are not  
[1:16:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4589) exclusive in other words they are buying  
[1:16:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4592) not just from Itachi - otherwise you  
[1:16:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4595) couldn't have enlarged the spectrum as a  
[1:16:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4598) matter of fact when you are looking on  
[1:16:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4602) how many what is a percentage of a  
[1:16:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4606) distributor buying from Itachi it's  
[1:16:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4608) about a little bit it's about reflected  
[1:16:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4612) in the size of attach in the world in  
[1:16:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4614) other words a wholesaler that is selling  
[1:16:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4616) Itachi tools probably holds something  
[1:16:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4619) like 10% of is offering from Itachi the  
[1:17:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4623) other 90% is other companies it's very  
[1:17:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4626) fragmented market ok so far it's  
[1:17:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4629) understood fine now put yourself in the  
[1:17:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4635) shoes of a distributor and look in  
[1:17:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4638) reality through his eyes not your eyes  
[1:17:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4641) or not Itachi eyes which is the eyes of  
[1:17:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4644) a manufacturer let's look on the world  
[1:17:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4647) through the eyes of a distributor why is  
[1:17:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4650) it so important to understand what is  
[1:17:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4653) his real needs and to what extent are  
[1:17:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4656) they satisfied or not is it understood  
[1:17:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4659) what is the real difference with  
[1:17:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4662) a wholesaler in a manufacturer in my  
[1:17:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4665) eyes there are two very important  
[1:17:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4669) differences the first one is that the  
[1:17:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4679) inventory in a distributor represents  
[1:18:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4683) more than 90 percent of the assets in  
[1:18:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4686) other the cash of a distributor is tied  
[1:18:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4689) up in inventory how not that the  
[1:18:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4691) inventory is not important in  
[1:18:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4694) manufacture but I don't know about even  
[1:18:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4696) a single case where the inventory in a  
[1:18:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4699) manufacturer is more than 50% of the  
[1:18:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4702) assets usually it's much less there are  
[1:18:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4705) other assets like the machines and so on  
[1:18:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4707) so forth ok so here we are talking about  
[1:18:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4710) one huge difference almost all the money  
[1:18:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4712) of a distributor is tied up in the  
[1:18:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4714) inventory there is another huge  
[1:18:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4717) difference if I will go to a  
[1:18:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4720) manufacturer and I will tell him I give  
[1:18:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4723) you unlimited line of credit no cash  
[1:18:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4727) problems can you double sales in one  
[1:18:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4731) year usually what will be the answer the  
[1:18:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4734) answer is forget it I need more markets  
[1:18:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4739) I need to develop more clients I have to  
[1:19:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4741) develop more products doubling sales in  
[1:19:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4744) one year forget it impossible if I will  
[1:19:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4747) come to a wholesaler with exactly the  
[1:19:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4751) same offer and I will tell him I give  
[1:19:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4753) you infinite line of credit can you  
[1:19:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4756) double sales in one year what is the  
[1:19:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4758) answer yes no problem  
[1:19:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4761) I will triple the portfolio of products  
[1:19:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4765) that I'm carrying I will double sales is  
[1:19:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4767) it understood now take these two  
[1:19:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4770) differences together and you immediately  
[1:19:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4772) see the vast difference in the approach  
[1:19:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4776) of a wholesaler to his business actually  
[1:19:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4779) a wholesaler knows that he is putting  
[1:19:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4785) his money in the inventory if he had  
[1:19:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4788) more money he could have got more profit  
[1:19:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4793) it is understood in other words he is  
[1:19:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4795) actually looking on his business like we  
[1:19:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4799) are looking on putting money in the bank  
[1:20:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4802) we put money in the bank we are looking  
[1:20:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4805) on the interest how much we are getting  
[1:20:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4806) back if we had more money we would have  
[1:20:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4809) got more interest not in percentage but  
[1:20:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4812) in absolute term is it as understood yes  
[1:20:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4814) or no now this is the key because now  
[1:20:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4818) look what is your reaction suppose that  
[1:20:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4822) you are now getting X let's say five  
[1:20:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4825) percent interest from the bank and don't  
[1:20:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4827) tell me what your real percentage now  
[1:20:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4829) who cares  
[1:20:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4830) suppose that you get five percent  
[1:20:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4832) interest from the bank and he comes  
[1:20:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4834) another Bank and says why want to switch  
[1:20:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4837) your money into my bank I will give you  
[1:20:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4840) seven percent what's your reaction what  
[1:20:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4845) about loyalty and you know what eight  
[1:20:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4848) percent now kiss goes by loyalty you  
[1:20:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4851) switch am i right yes or no hmm ten  
[1:20:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4856) percent  
[1:20:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4857) you switched ah it's so good to be true  
[1:21:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4863) where the cash but it will find out that  
[1:21:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4865) there is no cash then of course the  
[1:21:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4867) switch of course this is too good to be  
[1:21:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4869) true you will check where the catch  
[1:21:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4876) ladies and gentlemen look what happened  
[1:21:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4878) here what do we know Wendy can you read  
[1:21:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4883) again this drastic reduction in lead  
[1:21:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4887) time and the much better responsiveness  
[1:21:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4892) enables a reduction of inventory in the  
[1:21:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4895) supply chain the distributor's from  
[1:21:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4899) eight to two point four months or hello  
[1:21:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4905) if you talk in terms of interest by how  
[1:21:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4909) much we increase the interest of the  
[1:21:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4913) distributors by how much we increase  
[1:21:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4915) here their inventory turns when the  
[1:21:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4918) inventory goes down from eight months to  
[1:22:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4920) two point four  
[1:22:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4921) we have tripled the interest  
[1:22:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4926) it was 5% we are not talking about 7%  
[1:22:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4928) away with about 15% no ketchup moon that  
[1:22:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4934) what did we say here we said to go a  
[1:22:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4938) little bit up that in their environment  
[1:22:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4943) every six months they have to launch and  
[1:22:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4947) you family of cutting tools up read it  
[1:22:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4958) the demand for most products cutting  
[1:22:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4962) tools is sporadic and the customs of  
[1:22:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4965) their industry force them to launch new  
[1:22:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4969) product families of tools every six  
[1:22:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4972) months when new product families are  
[1:22:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4976) launched the older families become  
[1:22:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4979) obsolete  
[1:23:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4980) hello by the way if you look on how come  
[1:23:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4983) this craziness happening there I don't  
[1:23:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4986) have a choice because what is happening  
[1:23:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4988) in this industry every six months there  
[1:23:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4991) is a world exhibition if you are not in  
[1:23:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4995) the world exhibition you do not exist  
[1:23:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=4997) and in order to present in the world  
[1:23:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5000) exhibition you have to come with a new  
[1:23:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5002) family of products which is by far  
[1:23:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5004) better than the previous family so you  
[1:23:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5008) don't have a choice you yourself  
[1:23:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5009) obsoleting a family every six months  
[1:23:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5013) fine now let's go down and let see the  
[1:23:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5016) impact now we are in the wholesaler and  
[1:23:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5022) what did we say eight months of  
[1:23:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5025) inventory where every six months a whole  
[1:23:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5029) family become obsolete what do you think  
[1:23:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5032) happens to the distributor is not  
[1:23:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5035) exactly delighted he has to absolute the  
[1:23:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5039) whole part we stock when the inventory  
[1:24:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5042) is reduced to two point four it's not  
[1:24:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5044) only that you triple the interest you  
[1:24:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5047) almost eliminated the problem of  
[1:24:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5049) obsolescence do you understand that you  
[1:24:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5052) are talking about satisfying a  
[1:24:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5055) phenomenal need of  
[1:24:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5058) the distributor and ever recognized need  
[1:24:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5061) of the distributor and you're the only  
[1:24:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5064) one who can do it because you're the  
[1:24:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5065) only one can give such services because  
[1:24:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5069) you know to do it you had to cut your  
[1:24:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5071) lead time in half you had to improve  
[1:24:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5072) dramatically your judt performance this  
[1:24:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5074) is not something that your competitor  
[1:24:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5076) can do based on their decision like  
[1:24:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5079) reducing prices this is understood a  
[1:24:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5082) fantastic competitive edge  
[1:24:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5084) did you use it and the answer is not at  
[1:24:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5089) all they were waiting for the  
[1:24:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5092) distributor's to recognize it on their  
[1:24:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5095) own and slowly slowly react to it what  
[1:24:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5098) is my proof my proof is 20% increase in  
[1:25:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5103) sales in five years when you have the  
[1:25:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5106) biggest mafia offer ever  
[1:25:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5108) you know what the Mafia over enough  
[1:25:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5111) elects nobody can refuse what is  
[1:25:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5115) happening in look on it the distributor  
[1:25:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5119) is holding thousands and thousands of sk  
[1:25:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5123) use you are about 10% of it how much  
[1:25:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5126) time it takes a distributor until you  
[1:25:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5129) realizes let's surprise surprise no  
[1:25:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5132) matter what cutting tool he buys from  
[1:25:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5134) you on those cutting tools that he buys  
[1:25:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5136) from you is inventory 23 times more than  
[1:25:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5139) the average how much time it takes it is  
[1:25:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5141) to realize it and then we start react  
[1:25:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5146) most distributor have not realized it  
[1:25:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5148) yet don't forget how them difficult it  
[1:25:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5151) is when you are looking at and you don't  
[1:25:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5153) expect such a thing what would have  
[1:25:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5155) happen if it touchy would have done  
[1:25:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5158) something very simple going to their  
[1:26:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5160) distributors to the calculation of the  
[1:26:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5163) inventory turns on their product for the  
[1:26:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5166) distributor and then showing it to the  
[1:26:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5168) distributor and the distributor would  
[1:26:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5170) say too good to be true so he will check  
[1:26:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5174) the numbers himself and then you will  
[1:26:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5175) say that it's correct and then what  
[1:26:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5177) happens immediately startled and largest  
[1:26:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5179) portfolio with you and then we don't  
[1:26:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5182) talk about 20% increase in sales and we  
[1:26:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5185) don't talk about five years  
[1:26:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5189) why wasn't it done and look when I've  
[1:26:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5195) looked case by case by case care case  
[1:26:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5198) what do I see the constraint is in the  
[1:26:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5202) market at the same time you have  
[1:26:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5207) generated without noticing a decisive  
[1:26:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5210) competitive edge which means if you're  
[1:26:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5213) talking about focus what should you do  
[1:26:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5214) you should capitalize on it what do you  
[1:26:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5217) do instead you continue to improve the  
[1:26:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5219) operations which is already good in  
[1:27:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5222) other words rather than doing the  
[1:27:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5224) actions that should be done you're  
[1:27:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5226) wasting all your time on things that  
[1:27:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5227) shouldn't be done the exact opposite of  
[1:27:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5231) focusing don't you realize that that's  
[1:27:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5233) the case and now you start one last case  
[1:27:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5236) baking and it's all staring you in the  
[1:27:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5238) face and you see for heaven's sake wake  
[1:27:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5241) up and then you start to realize what is  
[1:27:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5248) the problem for example if I take this  
[1:27:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5251) case the real problem is first of all to  
[1:27:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5254) clearly verbalize the competitive edge  
[1:27:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5258) in other words to start to understand  
[1:27:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5261) what is the meaning of the need to start  
[1:27:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5264) to put it in words to define it and to  
[1:27:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5266) show how to go about it because as long  
[1:27:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5268) as you don't do that you don't know what  
[1:27:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5270) you've done the problem the major  
[1:27:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5275) problem that blocked me for quite some  
[1:27:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5279) time was the fact that the same  
[1:28:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5284) improvement in operation gave rise not  
[1:28:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5288) to a single decisive competitive edge  
[1:28:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5292) but to multiples decisive competitive  
[1:28:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5295) edge in other words the situation was  
[1:28:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5297) even better than I thought  
[1:28:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5299) depending on what is your products and  
[1:28:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5303) what is the nature of your clients the  
[1:28:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5305) same improvement operation gives totally  
[1:28:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5308) different this has a competitive edges  
[1:28:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5311) now to start to think in these terms and  
[1:28:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5314) to formulate it to cry  
[1:28:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5322) not so much because already in 93-94 the  
[1:28:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5330) main types of competitive edge were  
[1:28:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5332) formulated the fantastic breadth of the  
[1:28:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5337) competitive edges came out and then I  
[1:29:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5340) found out oh my god this is much bigger  
[1:29:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5343) than I thought  
[1:29:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5344) why because for my talking to companies  
[1:29:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5350) I found out that when they're talking  
[1:29:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5353) about a decisive competitive edge  
[1:29:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5355) they always they're almost always  
[1:29:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5358) talking in terms of technological  
[1:29:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5361) advantage you know we are coming with a  
[1:29:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5364) better product almost always what you  
[1:29:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5368) have to bear in mind is that when you're  
[1:29:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5371) looking on a decisive competitive edge  
[1:29:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5373) you have to look on two parameters not  
[1:29:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5374) one one is the magnitude of the need  
[1:29:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5379) that you are satisfying relative to your  
[1:29:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5382) competitors but the second element is  
[1:29:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5385) time how much time before the competitor  
[1:29:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5389) will close the gap is it understood what  
[1:29:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5394) is happening is that due to improvement  
[1:29:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5398) in technology in the base the base  
[1:30:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5401) material the base components what we  
[1:30:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5405) witness in the last 30 years is a  
[1:30:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5408) dramatic shrink in the window of  
[1:30:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5411) opportunity that is gained by  
[1:30:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5414) technological advantage for example when  
[1:30:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5419) IBM came with the first PC the XT the XT  
[1:30:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5424) was the best computer mini a lack of  
[1:30:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5428) whatever we call it computer in the  
[1:30:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5430) market for three years when a company  
[1:30:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5434) today comes out with the best PC which  
[1:30:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5437) is by the way twice as much twice better  
[1:30:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5439) than what is available how long before  
[1:30:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5441) the competitors catch up not just  
[1:30:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5444) ketchup but surpass do you know what the  
[1:30:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5446) numbers today four months  
[1:30:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5450) in other words this window of  
[1:30:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5453) competitive edge this window because of  
[1:30:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5458) the of the that is open by technology  
[1:31:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5461) not like 30 years ago is closing  
[1:31:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5464) dramatically fast before you are able to  
[1:31:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5467) really capitalize on it it's already  
[1:31:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5468) closed and still people are not think in  
[1:31:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5472) terms of there are many ways to get a  
[1:31:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5475) decisive competitive engine of just  
[1:31:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5477) technology look on that case a decisive  
[1:31:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5481) competitive edge you are answering  
[1:31:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5483) answering here the biggest need of the  
[1:31:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5487) retailer which is in his terms you  
[1:31:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5491) dramatically improve his inventory terms  
[1:31:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5493) which is exactly equivalent to you  
[1:31:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5496) increase the the interest okay but in  
[1:31:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5502) order to do that what we have to do you  
[1:31:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5504) have to change dramatically the way you  
[1:31:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5508) I mean the producer have to change  
[1:31:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5510) dramatically the way he produces this is  
[1:31:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5512) a paradigm shift what do you think takes  
[1:31:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5515) longer a technological thing or a  
[1:31:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5517) paradigm shift the paradigm shift takes  
[1:32:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5520) much much longer the beauty is that if  
[1:32:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5526) we are capitalizing on this competitive  
[1:32:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5529) edge we actually as we are going to see  
[1:32:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5532) done to pattern shifts one in operation  
[1:32:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5533) and one in sales and they have to be  
[1:32:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5537) done in sync to do two different pattern  
[1:32:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5540) shifts in two different functions in  
[1:32:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5542) sync this is minimum ten years until the  
[1:32:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5544) competitor will catch up so not only  
[1:32:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5546) that you get enormous competitive edge  
[1:32:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5550) the window is much much longer why don't  
[1:32:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5554) we move on it  
[1:32:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5560) I took the three major very different  
[1:32:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5567) from each other  
[1:32:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5569) competitive edges that is coming from  
[1:32:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5572) the same improvement in operation and I  
[1:32:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5575) have published it in my book it's not  
[1:32:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5577) luck  
[1:32:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5578) read it again you will see three very  
[1:33:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5581) different decisive competitive edges  
[1:33:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5584) because I wanted to show how big they  
[1:33:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5587) are and to what extent they all stand  
[1:33:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5590) from improvements in operation but what  
[1:33:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5592) extent they are different in nature  
[1:33:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5594) based on the products and the nature of  
[1:33:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5596) your clients and here the whole new  
[1:33:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5600) world and I'm saying how now results  
[1:33:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5605) like that which is being the best in the  
[1:33:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5608) world and nothing we can go by far more  
[1:33:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5612) than that and I was starting to talk  
[1:33:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5614) about it and I've lost all my people a  
[1:33:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5616) crazy LD is already in the clouds who is  
[1:33:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5622) crazy here in my vocabulary if your  
[1:33:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5627) constraint is in the market and you have  
[1:33:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5629) now a decisive competitive edge and you  
[1:33:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5631) don't move on it you are crazy and  
[1:33:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5634) instead you're wasting your time and  
[1:33:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5638) cultivating your ego by improving  
[1:34:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5640) operation slightly more I brought out  
[1:34:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5648) it's not lack there that to think sir  
[1:34:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5651) one was the former broad introduction of  
[1:34:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5656) the thinking processes now that I'm  
[1:34:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5658) explaining exactly how to do them but at  
[1:34:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5660) least I'm explaining what they are and  
[1:34:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5663) the second one is the main message of  
[1:34:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5666) this book the decisive competitive edges  
[1:34:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5668) that are coming and nobody pays  
[1:34:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5671) attention and I said there must be a  
[1:34:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5675) reason let's continue on and then I  
[1:34:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5677) found out what are the next huge  
[1:34:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5683) obstacles  
[1:34:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5684) to what extent this opening and touching  
[1:34:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5689) this decisive competitive edges are at  
[1:34:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5691) the same time because are so powerful  
[1:34:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5693) are bringing to the surface effect that  
[1:34:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5697) there are holes in the knowledge I'm  
[1:35:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5700) talking about the knowledge of  
[1:35:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5703) management in totality what was the  
[1:35:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5706) problem and I'm sorry but until 93 94 I  
[1:35:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5715) didn't even realize that there is a hole  
[1:35:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5718) in the knowledge until we start to move  
[1:35:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5720) on it I start to push on it and then I  
[1:35:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5722) found out what is missing ladies and  
[1:35:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5725) gentlemen as we said how many companies  
[1:35:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5727) have decisive competitive edge almost  
[1:35:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5731) nobody still self people have to sell  
[1:35:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5735) and they have to sell without a decisive  
[1:35:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5737) competitive edge yes the companies are  
[1:35:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5741) valid which means they can compete but  
[1:35:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5743) they are in the bread ocean what it took  
[1:35:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5750) me so long to realize is that when you  
[1:35:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5753) have a decisive competitive edge the  
[1:35:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5757) whole approach to the sales the whole  
[1:36:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5761) approach to the sales meeting is  
[1:36:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5763) shifting 180 degrees let's look on how  
[1:36:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5767) conventional a meeting sales meeting is  
[1:36:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5771) done you meet with the client you spend  
[1:36:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5776) five minutes building a rapport which  
[1:36:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5778) means you talk about golf or whatever  
[1:36:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5780) and then and then you start to talk  
[1:36:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5783) about your products and you open the  
[1:36:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5785) catalogues and you show samples and you  
[1:36:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5789) talk about your products and once the  
[1:36:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5791) client is already sick and tired of it  
[1:36:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5794) now start the real thing is you start to  
[1:36:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5796) fight about price am i right hello  
[1:36:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5799) that's conventional meeting and that's a  
[1:36:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5802) way to do it because you don't have a  
[1:36:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5804) decisive competitive edge but if you do  
[1:36:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5806) have it how he is now the meeting going  
[1:36:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5809) forget rapport you start directly and  
[1:36:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5813) what is your first thing the first aim  
[1:36:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5816) is to bring your client  
[1:36:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5818) to acknowledge that one of his decisive  
[1:37:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5822) competitive edges actually one of his  
[1:37:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5825) decisive needs is not satisfied to his  
[1:37:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5830) [Music]  
[1:37:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5831) delight like for example you meet with  
[1:37:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5835) the wholesaler and you start to talk  
[1:37:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5837) about how in how many inventories you're  
[1:37:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5839) holding and nevertheless because of it  
[1:37:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5842) not because it in spite of it you still  
[1:37:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5845) have shortages okay which can you  
[1:37:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5848) imagine a salesman telling such a thing  
[1:37:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5850) to a wholesaler what is he inviting fire  
[1:37:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5853) what is the masochist which means it's  
[1:37:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5858) inconceivable if you don't have the  
[1:37:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5859) answer but if you have it means the  
[1:37:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5861) whole operation starts let's talk about  
[1:37:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5863) the client let's talk about his needs  
[1:37:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5866) let's talk about his needs which are not  
[1:37:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5869) satisfied and how important it is for  
[1:37:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5871) him it will be satisfied and you  
[1:37:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5873) basically put the point finger more and  
[1:37:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5876) more to you and your competitors and  
[1:37:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5879) only when the fury of the client is  
[1:38:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5883) already there and he said what what does  
[1:38:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5887) he say he said what he would really like  
[1:38:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5889) to get from you much faster the river is  
[1:38:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5892) much more responsiveness and so on so  
[1:38:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5895) forth and then you say fine let me give  
[1:38:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5899) it you do you think that it's a hard  
[1:38:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5902) sale because what is now the reaction  
[1:38:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5903) too good to be true fine so let's do a  
[1:38:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5906) test I'll show you that we have capable  
[1:38:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5909) and you have it a totally different way  
[1:38:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5911) to sell ladies and gentlemen the power  
[1:38:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5915) and shift that exists in the cells is by  
[1:38:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5918) far bigger than the paradigm shift in  
[1:38:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5920) operation but when this is over when  
[1:38:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5925) this is done sales are not going up by  
[1:38:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5928) 20% in five years what a ridiculous  
[1:38:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5932) thing for heaven's sake you have the  
[1:38:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5933) biggest mafia offer you have almost  
[1:38:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5936) nothing of the world you have the  
[1:38:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5938) products already and you talk about in  
[1:38:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5939) terms of 20% of what they are are you  
[1:39:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5941) out of your mind but then what happens  
[1:39:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5949) first of all we started to realize we  
[1:39:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5951) have to invent the whole field of how to  
[1:39:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5954) do Excel when you have a decisive  
[1:39:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5956) competitive edge thank god here there  
[1:39:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5958) was also the frame done by somebody else  
[1:39:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5962) it was done by Rackham  
[1:39:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5964) did you ever heard about spin selling he  
[1:39:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5967) was talking about it before me so it's  
[1:39:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5970) simply this what was his problem we've  
[1:39:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5973) tried to do it all so when you don't  
[1:39:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5974) have a decisive competitive edge even  
[1:39:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5976) then it works to some extent because you  
[1:39:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5978) are talking about the real thing which  
[1:39:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5980) is you talk with the client about him  
[1:39:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5982) rather than about you remember it's much  
[1:39:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5984) much what is the most interesting  
[1:39:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5986) subject when you talk to somebody him  
[1:39:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5989) okay so already it's better okay but  
[1:39:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5993) here when you have a decisive  
[1:39:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5994) competitive edge is unbelievable be  
[1:39:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=5999) careful what you ask for you may get it  
[1:40:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6001) too much too soon and that's what we  
[1:40:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6005) started to find out what happens in  
[1:40:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6007) these places that we succeed to do it  
[1:40:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6011) and you know we the biggest block the  
[1:40:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6013) self people will tell you that it will  
[1:40:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6015) never work and you don't understand and  
[1:40:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6017) and and and and and the only way to do  
[1:40:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6020) it is to take them by the ear to the  
[1:40:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6022) client and you are the salesperson and  
[1:40:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6025) you talk and then the client is going  
[1:40:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6027) weary and wants to start the test  
[1:40:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6029) tomorrow and then at last the salesman  
[1:40:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6032) is willing to listen to you with what  
[1:40:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6033) the hell have happened here okay and  
[1:40:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6035) then you can teach then sales goes up so  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6039) fast  
[1:40:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6039) what happened then a constraint is back  
[1:40:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6044) in operation much faster than you think  
[1:40:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6048) and then what happens you are totally  
[1:40:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6051) not ready totally not ready and then all  
[1:40:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6055) your performance that's where the  
[1:40:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6057) basemap of the sales collapse totally  
[1:40:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6059) you might find yourself in a worse  
[1:41:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6061) situation that you started which means  
[1:41:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6065) what we needed to do is to develop the  
[1:41:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6069) knowledge of how do you control the  
[1:41:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6072) growth how do you make sure that when  
[1:41:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6075) cells are going up you still continue to  
[1:41:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6078) support these rows and sell but  
[1:41:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6080) never ever allow it to ruin your  
[1:41:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6086) decisive competitive edge that the  
[1:41:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6089) meaning of controlling it all of that is  
[1:41:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6093) under the topics of capitalized which  
[1:41:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6096) means to term the decisive competitive  
[1:41:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6098) edge that you've already done without  
[1:41:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6101) noticing because of your improvements in  
[1:41:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6103) operation into real sales but the most  
[1:41:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6107) important thing is a sustained to make  
[1:41:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6110) sure that the sales growth is such that  
[1:41:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6112) it doesn't kill everything but it's  
[1:41:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6116) controlled very well turns out it was  
[1:41:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6119) quite easy to develop the knowledge of  
[1:42:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6121) how to do this thing but that opened a  
[1:42:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6127) new frontier that at the time I didn't  
[1:42:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6132) realize how big and difficult it is  
[1:42:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6135) because now what we are talking about is  
[1:42:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6138) a following what the sequence should be  
[1:42:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6143) either you do it only in operation and  
[1:42:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6146) then allow for the forces of the market  
[1:42:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6150) to start to get advantage this is very  
[1:42:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6153) very slow but it's okay it's working  
[1:42:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6156) like he touch five years and if you are  
[1:42:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6159) Japanese you are number one the world if  
[1:42:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6161) you are an American you have killed  
[1:42:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6165) yourself a long time ago why because the  
[1:42:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6169) mean is that you have revealed twenty  
[1:42:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6170) percent excess capacity what do you do  
[1:42:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6175) if you are an American company you lay  
[1:42:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6178) off the people and then everything  
[1:43:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6180) collapse on your head okay you came to  
[1:43:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6183) the people the thousands improve the  
[1:43:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6184) improve now you are rewarding them by  
[1:43:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6187) laying them off do you think that it  
[1:43:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6189) really works moan that everyone that  
[1:43:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6192) knows do you see when it looks and  
[1:43:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6194) what's written here and when you please  
[1:43:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6195) move it to the beginning no what really  
[1:43:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6198) happened  
[1:43:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6201) why only 85  
[1:43:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6203) it should be minimum 95 excess capacity  
[1:43:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6208) that was revealed was 20% how come only  
[1:43:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6212) 20% and the answer is they put a drum  
[1:43:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6217) buffer rope but they didn't put the  
[1:43:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6219) buffer management so they basically left  
[1:43:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6222) half of the improvement on the table and  
[1:43:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6224) working harder but if they would have  
[1:43:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6227) put the buffer management the priority  
[1:43:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6229) system this means minimum in their  
[1:43:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6231) environment 40% excess capacity is  
[1:43:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6233) revealed and then the pressure to layoff  
[1:43:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6237) the people is huge but when you're doing  
[1:44:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6240) it right and immediately at the same  
[1:44:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6242) time you know what is happening and you  
[1:44:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6245) start to train the salespeople and start  
[1:44:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6247) to bring the orders  
[1:44:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6248) nobody even dreams of laying of the  
[1:44:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6250) people which means and here comes the  
[1:44:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6253) biggest warning either you do just  
[1:44:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6255) operation and leave the constraint out  
[1:44:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6258) in the market and don't focus continue  
[1:44:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6260) to deal with subjects in others to  
[1:44:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6263) continue to improve the operation you  
[1:44:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6265) know the definition of coop trick  
[1:44:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6266) everybody knows no this is the key word  
[1:44:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6270) in TC tube cheek  
[1:44:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6273) let's opposite the focus cheap chic  
[1:44:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6276) means pissing in the wind and feeling  
[1:44:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6280) very proud about it that's cute  
[1:44:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6284) it's the opposite of focus okay never  
[1:44:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6288) heard of it  
[1:44:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6289) bad way I'm feeling very proud about it  
[1:44:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6294) that the important thing I'm improving  
[1:44:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6297) the immaterial things okay  
[1:45:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6303) by the way triptych is the world in  
[1:45:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6306) Ukraine this is a derogatory word for  
[1:45:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6309) teenagers in Ukraine chup means this  
[1:45:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6313) part of the error koopchick  
[1:45:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6315) is for these teenagers who spend all  
[1:45:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6318) their time cultivating their soup  
[1:45:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6321) because that's what will bring the  
[1:45:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6323) chicks to them  
[1:45:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6329) I have the same impression when I'm  
[1:45:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6331) looking management anyhow it comes up  
[1:45:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6335) where biggest warning if you are moving  
[1:45:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6336) on capital lines for heaven's sake  
[1:45:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6339) exactly at the same time you have to  
[1:45:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6342) move on the sustain things are moving  
[1:45:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6344) here so quickly that if you don't put  
[1:45:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6347) the mechanism of sustain the increase in  
[1:45:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6349) cells will kill you it will kill the  
[1:45:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6351) competitive edge fine but that was what  
[1:45:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6356) what does it mean what takes longer to  
[1:46:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6360) train the salespeople to do this shift  
[1:46:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6363) which bees by the way means many times  
[1:46:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6366) redefinition of what is your target  
[1:46:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6368) markets because your target market is  
[1:46:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6370) not any more akin to the traditional  
[1:46:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6372) thing but according to which section of  
[1:46:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6375) the market the need is bigger and less  
[1:46:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6378) satisfied let's the places that you can  
[1:46:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6380) take it very well and this is not  
[1:46:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6383) usually one to one correspondence is  
[1:46:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6386) what you have so it's a change in  
[1:46:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6388) marketing it's a change in sales it's  
[1:46:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6390) training the salespeople this usually  
[1:46:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6392) takes longer than the change in  
[1:46:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6394) operation which is thank God for that  
[1:46:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6398) because now operation have improved  
[1:46:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6400) enough and then they can start to pull  
[1:46:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6402) all the sustain so that you don't have  
[1:46:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6405) to hold back the sells very hard to hold  
[1:46:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6408) back the cells once you realize oh my  
[1:46:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6410) god I can sell but this means what that  
[1:46:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6416) from the minute go you don't talk with  
[1:47:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6420) production alone you talk with  
[1:47:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6423) production and with cells and with  
[1:47:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6427) marketing at the same time do you know  
[1:47:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6429) how it is called in other words holistic  
[1:47:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6433) implementation and that's a must  
[1:47:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6437) and I grossly underestimated to what  
[1:47:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6442) extent the to see community whether it  
[1:47:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6447) is consultants or whether it is managers  
[1:47:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6451) in large companies are afraid of  
[1:47:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6454) holistic implementation care  
[1:47:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6456) fight and I find myself standing up  
[1:47:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6466) screaming holistic implementation  
[1:47:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6468) designing what I was calling at that  
[1:47:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6470) time default before and I'm talking to  
[1:47:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6472) the wind nobody's moving it one here one  
[1:47:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6478) there fine huge problem so what I said  
[1:48:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6490) is fine maybe they don't understand that  
[1:48:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6492) we actually covered all the functions  
[1:48:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6495) and what is the knowledge so with Wendy  
[1:48:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6499) I am as a matter of fact won't be much  
[1:48:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6504) more than me deciding to launch a huge  
[1:48:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6508) campaign to show the TLC knowledge is  
[1:48:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6511) improving each and every function in the  
[1:48:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6513) organization and for that we have put  
[1:48:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6517) together what is called was called the  
[1:48:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6521) satellite program  
[1:48:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6523) this was mammoth effort at the time  
[1:48:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6526) internet was not in existence we had to  
[1:48:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6528) use satellites when we had to organize a  
[1:48:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6531) network of six satellites and we have  
[1:48:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6536) run eight programs three hours each one  
[1:49:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6540) of them eight consecutive weeks where  
[1:49:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6543) I've showed that each and every function  
[1:49:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6547) in organization is already we know how  
[1:49:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6550) to focus first one was operation a the  
[1:49:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6554) production and the second one was a  
[1:49:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6556) measurement and the third one was  
[1:49:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6558) project which means engineering and the  
[1:49:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6562) fourth one was a supply chain  
[1:49:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6563) distribution and the fifth one was  
[1:49:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6566) marketing and sales and then human  
[1:49:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6569) interaction and then the last one was  
[1:49:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6571) overall strategy and I thought fine now  
[1:49:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6574) that it's recorded now that they see it  
[1:49:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6576) they will move unrealistic and nothing  
[1:49:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6580) happened to almost nothing happen  
[1:49:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6584) yes you are talking about already some  
[1:49:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6587) companies that have embarked on it and  
[1:49:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6589) you're talking about companies that now  
[1:49:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6591) are the showcases for the next problem  
[1:49:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6595) that I have ignored this was probably  
[1:50:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6600) one of the hardest lessons that I ever  
[1:50:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6603) had to swallow do you know what is the  
[1:50:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6607) biggest obstacles for achievement  
[1:50:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6611) setting the objective to low Sharpe it  
[1:50:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6615) again that's the biggest obstacle for  
[1:50:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6619) treatment setting the objective to low  
[1:50:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6621) and damn it I was the one who helped to  
[1:50:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6625) set objectives match to low  
[1:50:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6628) I was not ambitious enough one of the  
[1:50:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6633) hardest lessons that ahead to learn is  
[1:50:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6640) that whenever I see that people are not  
[1:50:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6646) doing the obvious and if you notice this  
[1:50:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6649) what happened on this journey again  
[1:50:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6650) again never ever to find refuge  
[1:50:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6655) energetic excuses like they're  
[1:50:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6659) conservative conservative that idiots  
[1:51:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6663) they have other interest in all this  
[1:51:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6665) mumbo-jumbo and to come to realize that  
[1:51:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6669) they are not moving just because of one  
[1:51:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6671) thing there is a missing piece in the  
[1:51:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6675) puzzle and it's my duty to find it if I  
[1:51:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6680) want people to listen to me if I don't  
[1:51:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6682) want people to listen to me that's fine  
[1:51:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6684) I can do nothing but if I do want them  
[1:51:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6686) to listen to me then instead of starting  
[1:51:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6688) to blame people and to start to imagine  
[1:51:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6692) derogatory things about them is to put  
[1:51:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6695) the finger back and to say a whole part  
[1:51:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6697) of the knowledge is missing find it and  
[1:51:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6700) when I cannot find it to say ah this  
[1:51:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6704) means that the piece which is missing is  
[1:51:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6707) much much thicker it's in the base  
[1:51:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6709) that's why I don't see it  
[1:51:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6713) this is exactly what happens here we  
[1:51:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6715) have to realize that what happened is  
[1:51:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6717) live the problem of unfocus ingrained  
[1:52:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6722) already very apparent in 93 when I wrote  
[1:52:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6726) it's not like it was even verbalized  
[1:52:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6728) here there is a market is a constraint  
[1:52:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6730) here there is a decisive competitive  
[1:52:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6733) edge and people are not moving on it how  
[1:52:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6735) crazy it is and then I went into the  
[1:52:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6737) holistic thing and I was talking about  
[1:52:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6739) the 4x4 and I've designed all these  
[1:52:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6742) eight days and frankly some clients have  
[1:52:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6747) moved on it very little but the  
[1:52:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6749) community at large did not move on it at  
[1:52:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6752) all so what's happening and yes I found  
[1:52:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6757) out the knowledge that was missing in  
[1:52:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6759) the capitalized and I found out how to  
[1:52:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6762) put the sustain and steel companies  
[1:52:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6764) we're not moving and then I realized  
[1:52:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6767) something much deeper is missing and  
[1:52:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6770) really something very deep was missing  
[1:52:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6773) the objective was not set correctly to  
[1:52:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6777) that extent the mistake was big let me  
[1:53:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6780) remind you where the objective of sports  
[1:53:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6782) objectives puts in the goals a do you  
[1:53:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6786) know a phrase like process of ongoing  
[1:53:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6792) improvement as a matter of fact it's  
[1:53:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6795) probably going through your ears out do  
[1:53:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6797) you know who invented this race most  
[1:53:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6801) probably it was invented into you see it  
[1:53:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6805) is the subtitle of the goal the goal was  
[1:53:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6810) called the goal process of ongoing  
[1:53:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6812) improvement it was so deep and after  
[1:53:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6816) that just in time an TQM embraced it  
[1:53:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6822) fully and everybody was pushing it only  
[1:53:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6828) at around 2000 I realized what mistake  
[1:53:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6832) there is in the interpretation of  
[1:53:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6835) process of ongoing improvement and to  
[1:53:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6838) what extent I have amplified the mistake  
[1:54:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6843) let me go back to basics process of  
[1:54:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6845) ongoing improvement what does it mean  
[1:54:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6849) if you just think about it for a second  
[1:54:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6852) it actually means that you are looking  
[1:54:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6862) on performance of the company and time  
[1:54:23](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6863) and as time goes by what you want is  
[1:54:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6871) that the performance of the company will  
[1:54:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6873) go in one direction up that's the  
[1:54:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6876) meaning of process of ongoing  
[1:54:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6877) improvement everybody understand very  
[1:54:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6882) nice what I recognized very early on is  
[1:54:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6887) that actually under that definition  
[1:54:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6891) there are two conceptually different  
[1:54:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6893) paths what we call today the green and  
[1:54:59](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6899) the red both of them are process of  
[1:55:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6904) ongoing improvement was the difference  
[1:55:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6906) the difference is that in the red the  
[1:55:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6910) absolute improvement per interval of  
[1:55:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6913) time goes up and that's why you get  
[1:55:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6917) exponential growth and in the green the  
[1:55:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6920) absolute improvement the period of time  
[1:55:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6922) goes down and that's why you are  
[1:55:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6924) reaching more and more diminishing  
[1:55:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6926) returns is it understood yes or no now  
[1:55:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6930) look on it when I approached crowds and  
[1:55:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6937) I have asked ladies and gentlemen  
[1:55:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6941) which curve the green or the red looks  
[1:55:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6945) more realistic to you what do you think  
[1:55:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6949) was the overwhelming answer which one is  
[1:55:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6953) looking more realistic two people agree  
[1:55:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6958) the minute that I started to realize to  
[1:56:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6961) what extent people are stopped to focus  
[1:56:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6963) and not putting their efforts you know  
[1:56:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6967) to capitalize on the competitive edge  
[1:56:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6969) that's already done even though the  
[1:56:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6972) constraint is in the market I started to  
[1:56:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6975) push with all  
[1:56:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6976) my might on the red and I was condemning  
[1:56:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6980) the green condemning the green  
[1:56:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6984) first of all I've showed what do you  
[1:56:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6986) mean by the red is not realistic for  
[1:56:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6989) example did you ever seen a company that  
[1:56:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6992) grows by 3% per year year after year  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6997) after year  
[1:56:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=6997) have you seen such thing hello many as a  
[1:56:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7001) matter of fact if you're a publicly  
[1:56:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7002) traded company that demand from you is  
[1:56:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7005) to grow by minimum the growth of the  
[1:56:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7007) world economy which is about 5% plus now  
[1:56:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7010) look three percent per year even means  
[1:56:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7013) that every year the absolute amount  
[1:56:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7015) becomes bigger which means if you plot  
[1:56:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7018) the curve of a companies that grow 3% a  
[1:57:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7021) year what you get is the red curve not  
[1:57:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7025) the green curve so why the hell do you  
[1:57:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7026) say that it's unrealistic ah for small  
[1:57:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7031) companies and big companies same thing  
[1:57:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7034) and by the way look at the biggest one  
[1:57:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7037) China what is the growth of the GDP of  
[1:57:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7040) China in the last 30 years 10% a year  
[1:57:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7045) here a theory of the you plot the GDP of  
[1:57:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7048) China and you see the exponent so what  
[1:57:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7052) do you mean unrealistic but I was going  
[1:57:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7054) out of my way to condemn the green curve  
[1:57:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7057) for me the green curve was and I've said  
[1:57:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7059) it so many times the green curve is not  
[1:57:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7061) pogey its stagnating on a higher level  
[1:57:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7066) this was probably my biggest mistake  
[1:57:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7071) ladies and gentlemen ask yourself how  
[1:57:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7074) come that even though people are seeing  
[1:57:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7078) the red curve in companies as a matter  
[1:58:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7080) of fact I got the green curve is  
[1:58:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7082) realistic from presidents of companies  
[1:58:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7084) that have the red curve what's so  
[1:58:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7087) attractive about the green and the  
[1:58:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7090) minute that you really start to answer  
[1:58:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7092) that you start realize this is not one  
[1:58:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7095) graph this is two graphs because when  
[1:58:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7097) you're talking about performance there  
[1:58:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7099) are two different type of performance  
[1:58:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7101) and you need them both one is called  
[1:58:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7104) stability and the other one is called  
[1:58:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7108) growth  
[1:58:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7109) hello financial growth and as a matter  
[1:58:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7114) of fact even you do the analysis and  
[1:58:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7116) remember what I've told you about the  
[1:58:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7118) sustain element you start to realize  
[1:58:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7121) that if you do not put the mechanisms  
[1:58:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7125) for stability growth collapse and if you  
[1:58:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7129) don't have growth you don't have  
[1:58:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7130) stability as well because of the  
[1:58:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7132) competition basically you must demand  
[1:58:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7136) the red curve in the financial  
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7138) performance  
[1:58:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7138) you must demand the green curve in the  
[1:59:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7142) stability performance every aspect of  
[1:59:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7145) stability Mon that when I start to  
[1:59:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7149) analyze it more I understood that this  
[1:59:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7153) phenomena that I was trying to hide at  
[1:59:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7156) the beginning of this graph is not a  
[1:59:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7158) fluke if you notice that at the  
[1:59:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7160) beginning the green grows much faster  
[1:59:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7162) than the red correct and that's how  
[1:59:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7166) implementations of TOC goes the first  
[1:59:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7168) actions improve the profitability but  
[1:59:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7172) the improve be far more stability and by  
[1:59:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7175) that you create the platform for people  
[1:59:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7177) to jump on the bandwagon and before the  
[1:59:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7180) change rather than against the change so  
[1:59:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7182) it's a must as a matter of fact but more  
[1:59:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7187) matter on that what I started to realize  
[1:59:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7189) is that this green curve is mandatory  
[1:59:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7194) for the red curve and vice-versa but  
[1:59:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7196) this means that the whole approach to  
[1:59:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7198) how to implement is different it means  
[2:00:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7201) that you have to think it over very  
[2:00:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7203) thoroughly  
[2:00:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7204) so whatever procedures whatever  
[2:00:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7206) mechanisms you are putting in order to  
[2:00:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7208) support the growth when you will have to  
[2:00:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7212) continue to higher and higher growth you  
[2:00:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7214) will not change these procedures you  
[2:00:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7217) just have to add on them that's the  
[2:00:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7219) meaning of real stability and there is  
[2:00:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7222) no end now to just to focus on that I've  
[2:00:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7228) changed the objective and because of it  
[2:00:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7230) I had to change the world and I started  
[2:00:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7232) to talk about ever flourishing companies  
[2:00:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7236) that the objective is not to increase  
[2:00:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7238) the profit it's not anymore  
[2:00:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7240) just making more money that I don't care  
[2:00:43](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7243) what I do care is to take a conventional  
[2:00:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7246) company and to turn them into an ever  
[2:00:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7248) flourishing company so the writings is  
[2:00:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7251) 50 years plus and the whole idea of ever  
[2:00:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7254) flourishing company means to invade in  
[2:00:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7257) the company the culture of how do you go  
[2:01:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7260) about the delicate balance of the green  
[2:01:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7265) and the red all the time and by that you  
[2:01:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7267) get much more stability than you ever  
[2:01:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7270) thought and the performance are going  
[2:01:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7273) into numbers that nobody's seen before  
[2:01:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7277) I'll give you some examples because the  
[2:01:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7280) world companies that things I've talked  
[2:01:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7281) about the holistic approach did listen  
[2:01:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7284) some of them have put their results in  
[2:01:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7287) the public domain one is very well-known  
[2:01:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7290) because it is a publicly traded company  
[2:01:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7292) this is First Solar  
[2:01:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7294) that's an American company go and check  
[2:01:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7297) their performance and you understand  
[2:01:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7300) what the meaning of red and green okay  
[2:01:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7302) this company started eight years ago  
[2:01:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7306) where the president went to the Joe  
[2:01:48](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7308) Nichols at that time the company was 40  
[2:01:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7313) people 2008 the company have made more  
[2:01:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7318) than a billion dollars credit public  
[2:02:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7323) credit so you can see their profit and  
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7325) so on  
[2:02:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7325) the beautiful thing was the comments on  
[2:02:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7329) that company in the first two quarters  
[2:02:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7331) of 2009 when them reported such huge  
[2:02:15](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7335) increasing profits in the midst of the  
[2:02:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7338) recession that everybody was saying  
[2:02:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7340) that's another Enron they must have  
[2:02:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7342) cooked the Box  
[2:02:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7344) right now they've crossed the two  
[2:02:26](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7346) billion you understand what's the  
[2:02:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7348) meaning of an exponent this is a pure  
[2:02:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7351) THC company every aspect of the company  
[2:02:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7354) is on it I would highly recommend you to  
[2:02:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7357) get for example the presentations that  
[2:02:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7361) they gave in QC I see oh it's captured  
[2:02:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7364) on video and to hear what they say about  
[2:02:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7366) it in what the meaning of of running  
[2:02:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7369) such a company last week I was in  
[2:02:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7372) Colombia and I've heard from one company  
[2:02:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7374) with all the results with every  
[2:02:57](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7377) on the green curve on the red curve for  
[2:03:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7380) nine years okay  
[2:03:02](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7382) and another company for 15 years the  
[2:03:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7386) beauty is that here is a real meaning of  
[2:03:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7389) stability here is there is a recession  
[2:03:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7391) the whole world collapse around you you  
[2:03:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7393) continue on the red and the green as if  
[2:03:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7396) nothing happens that's the meaning of  
[2:03:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7399) stability that's to what extent that we  
[2:03:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7401) ever immunize themselves that's the  
[2:03:25](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7405) objective and to do it on and on and on  
[2:03:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7407) of course how do you create such a  
[2:03:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7409) culture and so that was the problem and  
[2:03:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7412) what I found out is now now we have to  
[2:03:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7415) talk in terms of much bigger things and  
[2:03:36](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7416) now I know that the way to do it is take  
[2:03:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7420) use the red because in disabilities  
[2:03:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7424) there are no numbers  
[2:03:45](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7425) okay take the red put a target where  
[2:03:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7430) there is a total consensus around all of  
[2:03:53](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7433) management that it's unrealistic and  
[2:03:56](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7436) achieve it and then do it again twice  
[2:04:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7440) you have done the impossible while you  
[2:04:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7443) have maintained perfectly the green  
[2:04:05](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7445) curve and you've changed the culture now  
[2:04:08](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7448) they know how to continue to do it now  
[2:04:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7450) the whole attitude of the company have  
[2:04:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7451) changed it's not one person here that's  
[2:04:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7454) the meaning of ever flourishing when I  
[2:04:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7457) found out that nobody listens to me  
[2:04:19](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7459) anymore I came back from retirement by  
[2:04:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7462) the way I am retired now I'm not back  
[2:04:28](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7468) when I became 50 I've done for myself  
[2:04:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7472) big celebrations I've announced my  
[2:04:35](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7475) retirement and what is the meaning for  
[2:04:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7477) retirement means you from now on I will  
[2:04:40](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7480) do all the things that I want to do one  
[2:04:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7484) of the things that I hated to do badly  
[2:04:46](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7486) was to manage company managing a company  
[2:04:49](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7489) means you are a teacher in kindergarten  
[2:04:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7492) full-time job I hate it so I'm playing  
[2:04:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7498) some people in retirement playing with  
[2:05:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7500) golf I play with a little bit larger  
[2:05:03](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7503) ball but I'm doing only what I want but  
[2:05:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7507) then what I found out since  
[2:05:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7509) the community-at-large did not move on  
[2:05:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7512) these concepts at all as a matter of  
[2:05:13](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7513) fact I got a huge fight back from my  
[2:05:16](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7516) people saying it's impossible a I've  
[2:05:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7520) said then the golden book I'm talking  
[2:05:21](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7521) about 2002 with the determination to go  
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7524) in it  
[2:05:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7524) I have coined the phrase viable vision  
[2:05:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7527) which has said if you know what you're  
[2:05:30](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7530) doing in four years you have converted  
[2:05:32](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7532) the company from a conventional company  
[2:05:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7534) into ever flourishing company in other  
[2:05:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7537) words I think that four years are enough  
[2:05:39](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7539) to achieve twice impossible and to do it  
[2:05:41](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7541) rigorously and then we started and then  
[2:05:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7547) I found out oh more and more the  
[2:05:52](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7552) implementation standard to flounder  
[2:05:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7554) unbelievably the problem was that the  
[2:06:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7560) body of knowledge at that time was huge  
[2:06:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7564) already in 98 I've verbally put the full  
[2:06:10](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7570) solution for five segments of industry  
[2:06:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7574) huge segments makes to order make to  
[2:06:18](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7578) availability project based companies  
[2:06:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7584) equipment manufactures and retails  
[2:06:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7587) wholesaler I had the solution the full  
[2:06:31](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7591) solution of how to go on these curves  
[2:06:34](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7594) and then in 2002 I said ok you don't  
[2:06:38](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7598) want to do it whoever once join me let's  
[2:06:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7602) do it in the company that's what I call  
[2:06:44](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7604) the Bible visionary project and then we  
[2:06:50](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7610) start to work and I start to see  
[2:06:51](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7611) something is wrong what happened is that  
[2:06:55](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7615) the amount of knowledge was so vast that  
[2:06:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7618) first of all we started to run out of  
[2:07:00](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7620) good people because to create an expert  
[2:07:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7624) in this ocean of knowledge hours to  
[2:07:07](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7627) mention that time was three years and  
[2:07:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7629) probably not it's not enough so much  
[2:07:12](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7632) knowledge is already been there but  
[2:07:14](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7634) something much worse have happened which  
[2:07:17](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7637) is the amount of knowledge pair a single  
[2:07:20](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7640) company was so huge  
[2:07:22](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7642) that a lot of misunderstanding and  
[2:07:24](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7644) misinterpretations have happened which  
[2:07:27](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7647) slowed down the implementation  
[2:07:29](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7649) dramatically basically I realized there  
[2:07:33](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7653) is a tool which is missing how do you  
[2:07:37](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7657) organize vast body of knowledge in a way  
[2:07:42](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7662) that you can effectively communicate it  
[2:07:47](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7667) there was not such a tool in existence  
[2:07:54](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7674) that's was shocking moment to realize  
[2:07:58](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7678) that if I don't find that I will have to  
[2:08:01](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7681) limit our efforts dramatically and to  
[2:08:04](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7684) slow down dramatically so even though  
[2:08:06](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7686) the knowledge exists and the need exists  
[2:08:09](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7689) so much there is not a pipeline to  
[2:08:11](https://youtu.be/5HStf-XbsSo?t=7691) transfer this not
