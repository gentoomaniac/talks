Heidi Waterhouse - Developer Advocate at LaunchDarkly

ABSTRACT
I have sad news - staging is a lie and will never be identical to production, because production is unknowable. Trying to replicate it is often prohibitively expensive.
But I also have good news - production can contain multitudes, including features you aren’t ready to turn on or activate yet. You can hide in the dark and do integration testing at the same time.
It's simplistic to say that you should just kill the idea of a staging server and do everything in production. There are obviously problems with that - you need to do unit testing, you need to avoid things that will take down a service, you may need to do essential cutovers. But it's worth examining what benefit you're getting from staging and whether you could re-allocate that effort.
Join me for an exploration of the ways that you might be able to kill staging [...]

[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=4) [Music]  
[0:00:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=12) hi I'm Heidi Waterhouse and I am all  
[0:00:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=17) that is standing between you and big  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=18) band music so I'll try and keep it  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=20) snappy this talk is called all the  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=24) worlds of staging surfer and when people  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=27) ask me what it's about I say that it's  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=30) about the fact that we're all testing in  
[0:00:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=31) production and let's talk about that a  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=34) little bit but first I want to say that  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=37) this talk is part of one in a series of  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=39) four about something that I'm calling  
[0:00:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=42) the post-agile world and this is about  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=44) how a bunch of things are connected  
[0:00:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=47) together in a way that we haven't really  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=48) talked about much that I've seen there  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=52) are four elements of software  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=54) there's the deployments or development  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=57) style like how do you write the code how  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=59) do you define what's done when we had  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=63) shrink-wrap software we had the gold  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=65) master and we burned it onto a CD when  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=68) we had a j'l we had a story and when the  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=70) story elements were completed we were  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=72) done so development style changes how we  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=74) do something this is not about the  
[0:01:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=75) language you used source control changes  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=79) how you do things and a lot of you are  
[0:01:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=82) sort of scratching your heads because  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=84) how many of you have been coding for  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=85) less than say ten years right have you  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=90) ever used anything besides get no right  
[0:01:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=94) because that's all we've been doing for  
[0:01:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=96) almost 20 years is get and branch base  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=99) development and I want to I want to talk  
[0:01:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=101) about how we need to think about that  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=103) and the third one is testing how do we  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=106) decide whether something is is fit to  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=108) escape into the world and the fourth is  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=111) deployment how do we get it out to the  
[0:01:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=113) people that we want to have software and  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=115) when I was thinking about this I was  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=117) thinking about how you can't change one  
[0:01:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=119) of these elements without changing the  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=121) other and this is a gift from one of my  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=123) favorite YouTube projects called winter  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=125) gotten and it's an obsessive  
[0:02:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=130) Scandinavian musician who's making this  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=133) amazing thing that basically plays music  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=135) by dropping marbles unstuff and  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=137) don't go look now because you will kill  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=139) the Wi-Fi but trust me it's worth it in  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=142) the hotel so the other talks in this  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=146) series I'm just going to summarize them  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=147) quickly because it gives you some  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=148) context for where we are and because  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=150) they gave me 50 luxurious minutes so  
[0:02:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=152) you're all stuck with this  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=153) the first one is tinker toys and micro  
[0:02:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=155) services and it's the one that's about  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=157) testing and in it I say that full  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=160) testing is impossible and it is hard for  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=165) us to accept this because we've been  
[0:02:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=167) taught for a long time that testing was  
[0:02:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=169) something that you could be done with  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=170) that you could complete that there was  
[0:02:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=172) enough testing somehow decoupling all of  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=177) the bits of your infrastructure from  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=179) each other and putting I sort of think  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=181) of them as little elastic joints between  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=183) each other this is what micro service  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=185) architecture gives you is the ability to  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=187) have things be a little a little squishy  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=190) a little a little Givi because a  
[0:03:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=193) perfectly optimized perfectly tuned  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=196) perfectly efficient system is extremely  
[0:03:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=198) brittle the more brittle something is  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=201) the more catastrophic it is when it  
[0:03:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=203) breaks how many of you have dropped your  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=206) phone and broken the screen right and  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=208) what happens when you break the screen  
[0:03:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=210) on your phone lots of money probably  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=214) it's not even worth replacing the screen  
[0:03:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=217) because everything that goes into it is  
[0:03:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=219) too complicated and you just get a new  
[0:03:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=221) phone or you use it with a broken screen  
[0:03:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=223) for a long time I'm saying if it were  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=226) easier to replace the screens on our  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=228) phones we would have our phones for  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=230) longer be couple those but now for your  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=233) software and we want to test the  
[0:03:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=235) behavior and an end points because  
[0:03:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=237) although it is impossible to have full  
[0:03:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=239) testing it is possible to tell more or  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=242) less what people are going to experience  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=243) when they use your software the next  
[0:04:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=247) talk is called every SCARA story and  
[0:04:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=250) it's about development methods and this  
[0:04:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=254) one is about how agile development was  
[0:04:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=257) solving an extremely specific problem  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=259) and we haven't stopped and thought about  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=262) whether it's currently solving our  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=263) problem in a microservices world because  
[0:04:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=266) there's a lot of different ways we could  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=268) be solving this problem but everything  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=271) looks like a nail because all we have is  
[0:04:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=272) a hammer branches and branch base  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=275) development is a habit and not a mandate  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=278) what's the first thing you do when you  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=280) go to code something make a new branch  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=284) right like it just drilled into you it's  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=286) a spinal reflex at this point I'm not  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=289) saying don't make new branches because  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=290) coding directly and master is probably  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=293) not a great idea although a lot of us do  
[0:04:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=295) it on our personal projects all the time  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=297) um but let's think about what branch  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=301) base development is actually getting us  
[0:05:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=302) and questioning your assumptions about  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=305) that like why are we doing  
[0:05:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=307) source control this way why are we  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=310) controlling stuff this way because it  
[0:05:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=312) turns out there have been other ways and  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=315) there will be other ways it used to be  
[0:05:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=318) back in the day that when you were  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=322) working on a piece of software no one  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=324) else could work on that piece of  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=325) software there was a lock this was  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=328) magical we were using like visual  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=330) sourcesafe and you checked it out and  
[0:05:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=333) you worked on it and until you checked  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=336) it back in nobody could see it or touch  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=338) it it was yours so that seems like a  
[0:05:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=341) branch right except did I mention nobody  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=344) could see it if you got hit by a bus and  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=346) didn't check it back in somebody had to  
[0:05:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=349) go and try and break the lock on your  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=351) your source control that's kind of kind  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=354) of interesting it's a problem that we  
[0:05:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=357) don't think about much  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=358) and the third talk is this one called  
[0:06:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=362) all the world's a stage and in it I'm  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=365) going to tell you to kill staging I'm  
[0:06:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=367) going to talk to you about testing in  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=369) production I'm going to talk about  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=371) launching Darkly and I'm gonna explain  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=374) go faster be safer who here has read  
[0:06:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=377) accelerate a few people y'all go to  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=381) DevOps conferences don't you accelerate  
[0:06:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=384) is the hottest book of the DevOps world  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=387) this year and probably next year and for  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=389) the foreseeable future it's like our new  
[0:06:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=391) Phoenix project because what it says is  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=393) that the faster you go the safer you are  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=397) and it seems so counterintuitive the  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=401) faster you go the safer you are because  
[0:06:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=402) the smaller the commits you're make  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=404) and the smaller the danger it's really  
[0:06:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=408) hard for us to get our heads around that  
[0:06:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=409) because we're scared and I compare this  
[0:06:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=412) to learning to ride a bike when you're a  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=414) kid and you're your parents is teaching  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=416) you to ride the bike it's essentially  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=419) they're taking you and putting you on a  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=421) death machine and flinging you at the  
[0:07:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=422) pavement and saying go faster you're  
[0:07:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=425) like I don't want to go faster that's my  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=427) skin we're talking about not your skin I  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=429) don't want to go faster that seems  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=431) unsafe but what your parent knows and  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=433) you don't is that if you go faster  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=435) you're gonna stay up because you're  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=437) gonna have the stability there's a whole  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=439) bunch of physics involved in it but  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=441) mostly what you need to know is up to a  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=443) certain point it is far safer to go fast  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=446) on a bike than it is to go slowly on a  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=448) bike same is true for software and the  
[0:07:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=454) last talk is everything is a little bit  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=456) broken everything we use in life is a  
[0:07:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=459) little bit broken all our software is a  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=461) little bit broken everything is degraded  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=464) or failing or falling apart or not  
[0:07:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=467) optimal that's just how life is  
[0:07:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=469) every airplane you get on is a little  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=472) bit broken it's within parameters and  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=475) they have parameters that say if  
[0:07:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=477) anything if the door have you ever been  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=480) on a plane that got pulled off the  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=482) tarmac because they couldn't get one of  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=484) the door latches to latch or the toilet  
[0:08:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=486) to flush and you're like the plane can  
[0:08:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=488) fly come on but no there's a reason they  
[0:08:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=491) don't do that and it's because they've  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=493) exceeded their error budget and they can  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=495) only have so many things wrong on a  
[0:08:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=497) plane and if anything exceeds that  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=500) number they have to pull it off and  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=501) service everything it's like a an  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=502) indicator that they need to service  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=504) everything that's kind of amazing but  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=507) everything is broken and we need to  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=509) learn to deal with that so when we're  
[0:08:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=511) dealing with that we have to remember  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=512) effort can't be eliminated only moved  
[0:08:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=516) when they invented washing machines like  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=518) automatic washing machines they thought  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=521) that women were going to get so much  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=522) time back in their day it was going to  
[0:08:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=524) be amazing this is the best thing ever  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=526) because you're not going to have to like  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=528) boil water and scrub it and hang it out  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=532) to dry and iron everything like the  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=535) sheets that was a thing that we had  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=538) and everybody was like oh this is a  
[0:09:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=540) great great time-saving device it's not  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=543) a because we changed our whole standard  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=546) of like personal laundry and we started  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=548) using a bunch of different kind of  
[0:09:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=549) fabrics and we made it super gauche to  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=551) show up wearing the same clothes two  
[0:09:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=553) days in a row although that was totally  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=554) normal before washing machines and also  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=557) all the work that goes into designing  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=560) and building and distributing washing  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=562) machines and plumbing to make them work  
[0:09:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=565) and electricity  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=566) none of that work ever went away it just  
[0:09:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=570) got redistributed development is not  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=573) perfect no development can be perfect I  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=577) was just in Hillel stock and he talked  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=580) about how one of the things he tries to  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=582) do is make perfect software and I'm like  
[0:09:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=585) yes as an aspiration we have to all try  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=588) to make perfect software as a reality  
[0:09:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=590) none of us will make perfect software  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=592) and you have to understand that because  
[0:09:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=595) we're not perfect we are going to fail  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=597) and if we know we're gonna fail we can  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=600) make failures less bad we can mitigate  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=602) them ahead of time we're going to say oh  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=603) I know that's going to go wrong here are  
[0:10:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=606) some things that I can do to buffer that  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=607) I hope it goes well but I have to accept  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=611) that it's going to go wrong so one thing  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=619) to think about deployment is not release  
[0:10:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=623) deployment is the act of getting  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=625) something out onto servers or hardware  
[0:10:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=629) or media or your Alexa whatever it is  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=632) deployment is the act of getting it out  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=634) there release is where the business  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=637) value exists release is where somebody  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=641) says hey you should try this new feature  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=643) hey we're selling you new software pay  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=646) attention here is the business value  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=649) those are two entirely different ideas  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=653) right one person cares about how it  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=656) works  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=657) one person cares how to monetize it and  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=659) they're both important do not believe I  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=662) am saying release doesn't matter because  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=664) it does I like getting paid living in  
[0:11:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=666) doors and eating food like this is why  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=669) we do software right we enjoy  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=672) but you have to understand that maybe  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=674) different people are responsible for  
[0:11:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=676) those two different roles  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=677) maybe IT maybe ops maybe development is  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=682) doing deployment maybe marketing maybe  
[0:11:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=685) sales maybe QA is doing release  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=689) different teams different priorities  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=692) because we are all doing testing and  
[0:11:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=695) production  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=696) some of us admit it but you have that  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=701) moment you have had that moment where  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=702) you push something to production and you  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=704) thought it was going to go great because  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=705) it went great at testing and  
[0:11:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=707) everything's fine and and it didn't go  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=709) great and your server is either  
[0:11:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=713) metaphorically or literally on fire and  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=715) the users are unhappy because you can't  
[0:12:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=720) test everything in production or test  
[0:12:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=722) everything in testing so we sit down and  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=726) we tell these sad stories about  
[0:12:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=727) disasters that have happened about the  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=729) time that we pushed and and not only did  
[0:12:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=732) it not work but it took down like 14  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=734) other things at the same time it's a  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=737) thing we do we sit down and we tell sad  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=739) stories and we call them war stories but  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=742) really they're just like a sympathy fest  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=745) because staging is a lie staging is the  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=750) worst kind of lie because it's a  
[0:12:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=752) plausible lie it says okay this is an  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=756) environment like production you're going  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=758) to test this thing like production  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=759) everything is going to be like  
[0:12:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=760) production who here can stand up staging  
[0:12:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=763) that is exactly the same as production  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=764) oh no sometimes I have AWS people in the  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=770) audience and they're like yo we do the  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=773) rest of us are not living in that world  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=776) we can't because we don't have I hope  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=779) all of the user data in our test server  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=782) right because we don't have all of the  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=786) weirdness of like other people's  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=788) microservices because there's a  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=790) licensing thing that says we only have  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=792) so many licenses and we're not going to  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=794) spend one of those licenses on testing  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=795) when we need them all for production I  
[0:13:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=797) don't know why I don't know why your  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=800) production environment is not the exact  
[0:13:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=802) mirror of your development  
[0:13:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=804) environment but I assure you that's true  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=808) and every time you test it I'm staging  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=810) and think that you know what's going on  
[0:13:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=812) you're missing something you're missing  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=815) people with one letter last names you're  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=818) missing people with fifteen-year-old  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=819) accounts that are in a super weird state  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=821) you're missing people who are using  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=824) things in on an old phone that you  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=826) didn't even think to support because who  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=829) could possibly even still have a battery  
[0:13:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=830) in that thing right now there's somebody  
[0:13:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=833) out there this code is working fine and  
[0:13:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=839) staging not in life there were a lot of  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=843) choices that I had to pick one of these  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=846) quotes out as a search term it's long  
[0:14:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=849) and sort of painful to read we don't  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=852) know we don't know what's going to be  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=855) different between staging and life and  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=856) finding it is sometimes a real emergency  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=862) because you're like but I need to be  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=864) able to push this because you have not  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=865) be coupled deploy and release and you  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=867) have a release deadline bearing down on  
[0:14:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=869) you and you're like I I don't know why  
[0:14:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=871) it's not working we plan to go live  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=873) today and I pushed it to live to  
[0:14:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=875) production and nothing happened so I  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=881) talked a little bit about how it's  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=883) expensive to duplicate Green is  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=886) expensive blue green is expensive it's  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=888) really expensive to duplicate everything  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=891) one of our customers coder comm has  
[0:14:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=896) figured out how to solve the staging is  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=898) expensive problem  
[0:14:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=899) what they did was stopped using staging  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=902) they're taking all the money that they  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=904) were using for staging servers save  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=906) staging hosting and they're spending it  
[0:15:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=909) on feature flex and they're just dumping  
[0:15:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=911) their code directly to their production  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=914) servers who gets the willies does that  
[0:15:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=916) sound terrible yeah so far it has not  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=920) blown up for them because they're hiding  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=922) them behind feature flags it's not like  
[0:15:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=924) customers can see this there's dump two  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=928) production it's all hidden it's all  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=931) happening behind a whole set of  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=933) safeguards that keep ordinary people  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=936) from seeing it but  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=938) coder comm is testing in production all  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=940) the time they don't even have staging  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=944) that's kind of an amazing story I love  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=947) this idea I will say that launch darkly  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=950) still has a staging server that we use  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=951) for integration testing I'm not saying  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=953) like a hundred percent nobody needs  
[0:15:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=955) staging but for this particular use case  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=957) it worked out  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=959) production is unknowable  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=962) we can't know why it's weird this  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=964) picture is a part of your body that you  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=967) did not learn about in school this is  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=969) your interstitial which means like  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=972) middlee bits it's the technical  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=974) definition of how we translate  
[0:16:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=976) interstitial really we didn't know he  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=979) had this organ because it's filled with  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=982) fluid and it's woven through our entire  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=985) body sort of like the lymph system but  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=987) like with fewer nodes and we didn't know  
[0:16:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=989) we had it because every time you cut  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=992) into it what happens when you cut into a  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=994) tube under pressure it collapses so we  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=999) thought we had like all this weird  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1000) fibrous stuff between our muscles and  
[0:16:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1002) throughout our body and it's like okay  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1004) this is just like weird stuff that holds  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1007) our organs together but no it turns out  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1009) this is a whole organ that we didn't  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1012) know we had until we had good enough  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1014) imaging to find it and we're like hey  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1016) what are those tubes that appear to be  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1018) under pressure and full of fluid oh no  
[0:17:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1022) no everybody has them and huh we don't  
[0:17:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1026) know what they do yet we're pretty sure  
[0:17:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1028) they're important and that we're gonna  
[0:17:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1032) study that some more production is the  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1034) same way there are things that you can't  
[0:17:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1037) test because testing them is the  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1039) equivalent of cutting into them because  
[0:17:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1041) until is operating live with live user  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1044) data you don't actually know what's  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1047) happening you're only dissecting things  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1050) you're not watching how they work so  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1054) when we're testing in production this  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1057) slide is actually from Cindy Sri Hans  
[0:17:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1061) excellent post about testing in  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1063) production and it's about how many  
[0:17:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1066) incidents happen and whether or not you  
[0:17:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1069) can take your incidents down by testing  
[0:17:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1071) in production  
[0:17:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1073) but so okay I've made you all sad about  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1076) how you're testing right let's cheer up  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1080) production can contain superposition how  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1084) awesome was the the first keynote today  
[0:18:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1086) like the one about quantum computing  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1089) with frosted donuts I'm not sure which  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1091) part I was more interested in but it  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1093) might have been the frosted donuts oh  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1094) but superposition is a super useful idea  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1097) and not just for quantum computing but  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1099) also for modern computing in that we can  
[0:18:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1102) think about things co-occurring with  
[0:18:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1105) different visible effects so when I say  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1108) I'm going to test with feature flags  
[0:18:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1111) what I'm saying is I have put code on  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1114) the server that is both on and off at  
[0:18:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1117) the same time you know Schrodinger's  
[0:18:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1119) code until I tell it what to do it's  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1123) probably off and when I tell it what to  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1127) do it can be on but it doesn't have to  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1129) be on for everyone it could be on just  
[0:18:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1131) for people in Florida who are over 60  
[0:18:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1134) okay  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1135) or it could be off for everyone over 60  
[0:18:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1139) because it's only the hottest memes  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1141) whichever it is we can say that code  
[0:19:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1146) exists and behaves and this code exists  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1148) and behaves at the same time operating  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1152) at the same time on the same servers  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1154) with the same everything that's how we  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1157) test in production  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1163) the other thing that you can do if you  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1166) feature flagged all the stuff that  
[0:19:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1167) you've put in production is turn it off  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1169) really fast because who here has had to  
[0:19:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1172) do an emergency redeploy yeah yeah right  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1175) and and how much did you hate it like  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1177) two hands for I really hated it yeah  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1180) right because what happened is something  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1182) went wrong and the way you fix it is do  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1185) another deploy most people in in like  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1190) the modern aspirational world those  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1193) people I'm talking to their deploy time  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1196) is still north of ten minutes sometimes  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1198) as much as three hours right shout-outs  
[0:20:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1202) anybody under ten minutes yeah finish  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1207) what if I told you less than a second  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1210) what if I told you you biffed it and we  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1213) had a detector on that and we know you  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1215) biffed it and I'm gonna turn that thing  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1218) off  
[0:20:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1219) we're just gonna roll forward we're  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1220) gonna turn off that that animated cat  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1224) falling gif and we're just going to go  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1225) forward until we can figure out why  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1227) that's broken that's so much better than  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1229) a redeploy because it's all the things  
[0:20:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1232) that are working and just not the one  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1233) thing that's not working so to take an  
[0:20:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1239) example that is not software because I  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1240) cannot talk about software for 50 whole  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1242) minutes it's just not in me this dress  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1245) has had more than one state when I made  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1249) it I put it on and I'm like oh this  
[0:20:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1252) fabric is very different than the last  
[0:20:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1254) fabric I made it in it it technically  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1256) it's called the drape of the fabric the  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1258) way it hangs and so I took it off and I  
[0:21:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1261) reset it both states of the dress have  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1265) existed in time but they are  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1269) differentiated so one of them went down  
[0:21:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1272) one leg of the trousers of time and the  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1274) other one is in front of you now but  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1276) it's the same dress I've just modified  
[0:21:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1279) it so when you're thinking about your  
[0:21:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1281) code you don't have to think about it as  
[0:21:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1283) like the never and the always you can  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1287) think about it as the sometimes which  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1289) one is the sometimes which one do I want  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1291) to happen this time you can hide in the  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1296) dark  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1297) when we talked about this we say dark  
[0:21:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1300) launching and I think it's a really  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1302) interesting idea because it came out of  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1305) a project that Facebook did where they  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1310) knew that assigning usernames was going  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1312) to be a shitshow I think that's the only  
[0:21:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1315) technical word I can use for that and  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1318) they wanted to make sure that everybody  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1320) had a roughly equivalent chance of  
[0:22:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1322) getting the name they wanted all over  
[0:22:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1324) the world at the same time so four  
[0:22:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1326) months ahead of this rollout every time  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1328) you logged into Facebook there was also  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1330) a shadow you that logged in and  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1332) requested an arbitrary name so that they  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1335) could tune and refine the way that this  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1337) thing behaved until they were finally  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1339) convinced that it was going to work on  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1341) the day and it did and that's kind of  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1344) amazing when you think about the number  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1345) of people who were hitting the servers  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1347) at the same time of the things that they  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1349) were requesting but because it had all  
[0:22:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1351) been tuned and refined in the dark  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1354) when we turned the light on everything  
[0:22:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1356) worked great so what is the thing that  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1362) we want to be looking at how is it we  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1364) understand that something is working for  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1370) software we can do a soft launch but so  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1374) can restaurants restaurants do a soft  
[0:22:57](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1377) launch because it turns out that it's  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1379) really a bad idea to promote everything  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1381) and have like your full capacity plus  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1384) some show up and still be figuring out  
[0:23:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1386) how to run tickets and you could have  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1388) practiced that but you have never  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1390) practiced it with people who are cranky  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1392) about not having their you know their  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1394) steak yet and so they do a soft open  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1396) where they're like hey we're open but  
[0:23:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1397) we're not telling anybody if you happen  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1399) to wander in we'll give you food I want  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1401) to be able to do that for software to I  
[0:23:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1403) want to be able to find the problems in  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1406) a small group in a canary group in in a  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1410) group that it's only internal users like  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1413) Microsoft calls this ring deployment and  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1416) they deploy to the group that made it  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1419) and to the next round out which is  
[0:23:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1423) sometimes the beta users and sometimes  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1426) other Microsoft groups and then they  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1428) deploy to a canary group  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1430) and they make sure everything is fine is  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1432) everybody happy have we impeded our  
[0:23:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1434) performance statistics is everything  
[0:23:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1436) going ok and then they do a progressive  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1438) deployment where they do 10% at  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1441) increasing rates so it's not like the  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1444) feature has ever switched on like like  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1447) throwing a giant switch it's more like  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1448) the feature sort of trickles out into  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1451) the world until it's fully out when I  
[0:24:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1455) think about this problem I think about  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1457) Best Buy a few years ago they had the  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1460) worst Black Friday ever now Best Buy has  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1464) an interesting foible in that they have  
[0:24:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1465) data centers because it turns out they  
[0:24:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1468) don't want to give any of their  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1469) competitors money I can certainly  
[0:24:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1471) understand at this point of view they're  
[0:24:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1473) like hello we're Best Buy we are not  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1475) buying AWS compute fair fair but they  
[0:24:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1480) had data centers which means they don't  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1482) really have much capacity for elastic  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1484) scaling which means that when they went  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1486) down all they had was their data centers  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1489) so the first thing that happened is they  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1491) tried to stand their servers back up and  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1493) the second thing that happened was a  
[0:24:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1495) thundering heard of people who wanted to  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1496) do Black Friday shopping all tried to  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1499) hit the web server at the same time and  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1501) it tried to load this enormous page with  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1503) like pictures and animations and a  
[0:25:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1506) shopping cart and like you know you know  
[0:25:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1509) the kind of page I'm talking about and  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1510) even if they could have maintained  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1514) normal good for normal Black Friday  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1516) loads they could not maintain serving  
[0:25:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1519) the whole page to Black Friday loads and  
[0:25:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1522) so every time they tried to stand up  
[0:25:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1524) they fell over again because they didn't  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1526) have capacity it took hours hours is not  
[0:25:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1531) a word you want used around your Black  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1533) Friday sales one of the things that that  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1537) they finally ended up doing was doing  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1539) some traffic shaping so that they only  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1542) let through a percentage of people at a  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1544) time until that percentage of people had  
[0:25:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1547) actually gotten the page loaded and then  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1548) they let through another percentage  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1550) until that percentage had gotten the  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1552) page loaded and that's how they finally  
[0:25:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1554) managed to get their servers back up and  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1555) working more or less but what a  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1558) nightmare what a nightmare because it's  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1560) so easy to see how that would happen to  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1563) us  
[0:26:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1563) the  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1564) what even like high-load is is not the  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1566) same as high loading load like high  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1569) instantiation load that's a whole  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1571) different problem integration testing  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1575) takes a lot of forms a lot of the things  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1577) that we do for integration testing are  
[0:26:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1579) obvious we're like okay well the first  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1582) thing that we do actually is unit  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1584) testing I can't check into anything  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1586) until I've done my unit test right  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1588) you're not letting people put things in  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1590) your CI CD pipeline without unit testing  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1592) are you no way thank you yeah no so you  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1597) do your unit testing and then you kind  
[0:26:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1600) of do your integration testing as much  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1601) as you can but like we said before there  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1603) are micro services that don't belong to  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1605) you  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1605) and you're going to have to test those  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1607) in production so what you're gonna have  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1610) to do is figure out how to get something  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1612) into production and test it without  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1616) showing it to anybody I love this  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1620) picture and I'm also very sad it's a  
[0:27:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1623) picture that the opportunity Rover took  
[0:27:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1626) before it went dark on June 10th  
[0:27:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1630) opportunity was designed for an  
[0:27:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1634) effective lifespan of months they're  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1637) like maybe we'll get a year out of it  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1640) 15 years later it was still sending us  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1644) data that is a marvel of engineering I  
[0:27:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1648) am so impressed and excited by the team  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1652) at JPL that built this and when we asked  
[0:27:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1654) them how they did it they said we made  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1658) everything independent nothing is  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1661) dependent on each other  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1663) so if our rock boring drill goes down it  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1668) doesn't matter because there's another  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1670) thing or there's a couple radio systems  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1672) on it so that if one radio system is hit  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1675) by a micrometeorite or whatever they  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1678) still have a secondary radio system if  
[0:28:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1680) we want something to last for a really  
[0:28:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1683) long time we have to build it with the  
[0:28:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1685) capacity to operate in a dysfunctional  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1688) way think of it this way if you can't  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1693) push broken code into your continuous  
[0:28:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1696) delivery pipeline  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1698) you are not doing continuous delivery  
[0:28:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1700) it's not like the Mars rover can say hey  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1703) I don't feel so good today my rock  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1705) boring laser is broken we can't fix it  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1708) you have to be able to operate in a  
[0:28:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1710) degraded condition and the more  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1713) resilient you are the more you can get  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1716) your core functions done in a degraded  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1718) condition all right so you're asking  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1722) this is your moment or you're like yo  
[0:28:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1724) Heidi that that sounds great but I have  
[0:28:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1726) some questions about the people I work  
[0:28:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1728) with who are definitely not me so what  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1732) about testing like how are you going to  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1735) handle testing I'm like well how do you  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1738) handle testing now I'm not saying stop  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1739) testing I'm saying do more test it I'm  
[0:29:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1741) saying admit more testing I'm saying all  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1744) the testing but like I said you have to  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1748) be aware of what value each kind of test  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1751) is bringing you are you checking to make  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1753) sure that it works are you checking to  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1756) make sure it doesn't break other things  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1757) are you checking to make sure it works  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1759) with your data are you checking to make  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1761) sure it doesn't break your data actually  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1764) sitting down and writing these out in  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1765) human language is a great exercise we  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1767) used to have QA people who did this and  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1770) they were geniuses and I think we should  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1772) go back to hiring them but I feel like  
[0:29:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1774) that about technical writers too so this  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1778) is my new career when we're doing  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1781) testing we need to not just be doing  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1783) testing for the sake of having done  
[0:29:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1785) testing testing not just for like I  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1788) think of it as like potemkin testing oh  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1791) I have 96% code coverage yeah and like  
[0:29:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1796) this does your stuff work if are the  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1799) users happy charity majors has the best  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1802) slide in the world that says 9's don't  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1805) matter if the users are unhappy and and  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1808) that's such a pithy summary of what all  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1810) testing is about nines don't matter if  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1813) the user is unhappy I don't care what  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1815) your test says if the user is not  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1817) getting what they need if the business  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1819) is not getting the value I don't care  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1822) like your software is a hundred percent  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1824) useless if no one can install it so  
[0:30:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1828) testing it's really important but you  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1831) need to be  
[0:30:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1831) testing based on behavior based on  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1834) experience based on usability all right  
[0:30:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1839) so yeah sometimes we have to do testing  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1845) on the ground because when we get  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1847) something I don't know into orbit we  
[0:30:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1850) figure out we got something wrong and  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1851) then fixing it is really hard so the  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1855) earlier you can catch problems the  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1856) better this is a picture of the Hubble  
[0:30:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1859) telescope by the way it occurs to me  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1860) that that's not Universal knowledge when  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1863) they got it into orbit they realized  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1864) that they had made Mis shaped it by some  
[0:31:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1867) tiny fraction of an inch but when you're  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1869) talking about looking at like the  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1871) farthest things in the galaxy tiny  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1872) fractions of an inch matter and so they  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1875) ended up doing a whole new project to  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1878) essentially get into orbit and attach to  
[0:31:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1881) the telescope a pair of glasses like a  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1885) corrective lens for the amount that they  
[0:31:27](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1887) had ground it wrong that's not trivial I  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1890) wish that the testing on the ground had  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1893) been better because we could have fixed  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1894) it a lot easier then so what about bad  
[0:31:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1899) ideas right everybody knows that there's  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1902) that that one p.m. who has a million bad  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1905) ideas and they want to launch them all I  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1907) love that guy he's awesome  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1909) because sometimes his bad ideas are  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1911) awesome and it turns out users love them  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1913) and sometimes they're really  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1914) catastrophic and so what I want to have  
[0:31:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1918) is a way to say that idea we're gonna  
[0:32:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1922) try it we'll run our experiment we are  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1924) science based here we will we will test  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1927) it with a very small percentage people  
[0:32:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1929) and if they hate it you owe me five  
[0:32:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1931) dollars and we're taking it out of  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1933) production and if they like it I owe you  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1936) five dollars and we roll it out to  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1938) everyone because you can't really tell  
[0:32:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1940) until you until you experiment whether  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1944) or not something is useful whether or  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1946) not it's practical whether or not it's  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1948) usable because we know what we know but  
[0:32:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1951) we're software nerds like we are  
[0:32:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1954) spending a day several days at a  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1957) conference sitting in warm rooms  
[0:32:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1959) listening to people showing us slides we  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1962) are not representative and we have to  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1965) stop the  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1965) taking of ourselves that way also are  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1967) you all enjoying the Wi-Fi issues yeah  
[0:32:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1970) you realize this is how most of the  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1972) world lives actually most of the world  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1974) would kill for Wi-Fi like the Wi-Fi  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1975) we're getting we don't think about this  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1978) because we go to our work and we have  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1981) fast constant on-demand all the time no  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1984) problems Wi-Fi my parents live in a  
[0:33:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1987) cellphone dead spot literally 90 minutes  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1991) from Seattle no cell phone reception  
[0:33:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1993) it's very relaxing there's a lake in a  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=1997) mountain it's very relaxing but if they  
[0:33:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2001) needed to call 9-1-1 on a cell phone  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2002) they couldn't it's not possible so when  
[0:33:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2006) we're doing this we need to remember  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2009) that not everybody is experiencing the  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2011) world the same way we are  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2013) okay what about essential cut overs I  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2016) call this the database question you  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2019) remember how I said we should keep  
[0:33:41](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2021) hiring QA and tech writers I also feel  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2023) that way about DBAs because they know  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2025) how to solve this problem already and we  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2028) are sort of like back engineering  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2030) decades of knowledge that already exists  
[0:33:52](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2032) which is regrettable and wasteful but  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2036) what about essential cut overs what if I  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2038) told you it wasn't just blue and green  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2040) what if I told you that you could have a  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2043) database that had a and a database that  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2046) had B and a way to have a and B writing  
[0:34:11](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2051) to the table at the same time and then  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2053) when you were sure and secure that a and  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2056) B were writing correctly you could fade  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2058) out a and cut over to be slowly and  
[0:34:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2061) gradually with lots of metrics and  
[0:34:23](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2063) testing that would be so much better  
[0:34:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2066) than like flipping the giant monster  
[0:34:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2069) like let's see navient my student loan  
[0:34:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2073) provider sent me an email telling me  
[0:34:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2075) that they were going to be down for five  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2077) hours randomly on a Saturday and I'm  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2079) like you're doing a deployment you're  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2082) doing a cut over you're doing some kind  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2084) of major conversion effort and you just  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2086) don't want anybody touching the site  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2088) it's touching the state of your database  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2090) for five hours if only we lived in the  
[0:34:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2095) 21st century people  
[0:34:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2098) but that's how it still works for a lot  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2101) of people but it doesn't have to we we  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2103) can do better we have the tools we have  
[0:35:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2105) the technology you can make it better  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2107) faster stronger than before so here's  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2114) what I'm going to tell you to do here is  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2116) my charge to you launch Darkly stop  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2120) thinking of launch as a thing that  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2124) happens all at once deploy test test  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2128) test iterate test test then launch  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2133) because that's the way you're going to  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2135) get actual real results branch by  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2139) abstraction because there's no reason to  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2142) have hundreds of long-lived branches  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2146) even though you have hundreds of  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2148) developers you could have them merging  
[0:35:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2151) in all the time so you could do see ICD  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2154) continuous integration continuous  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2156) deployment so that nobody is stepping on  
[0:35:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2159) anybody else's toast because all the  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2160) code is in the trunk and all the  
[0:36:03](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2163) branches are psychological they're  
[0:36:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2166) abstractions they are only in our  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2170) imagination and they are controlled by  
[0:36:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2173) future flags it's a thing a lot of big  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2176) companies do like oh you know Google and  
[0:36:20](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2180) Facebook and LinkedIn and AWS a lot of  
[0:36:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2184) people are using this pattern but we  
[0:36:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2186) haven't really had it trickled down to  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2189) people who are sort of in the mid tier  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2191) and I think we should test in production  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2194) because you're testing in production  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2197) anyway you might as well own it and put  
[0:36:40](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2200) some metrics on it  
[0:36:42](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2202) Microsoft told me that their definition  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2204) of done was not when something was  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2206) deployed and it was not when something  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2208) was launched it was when something with  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2211) public and returning metrics like whoa  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2215) that's an amazing definition of done  
[0:36:59](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2219) when it's returning metrics when I can  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2221) see what it's doing because that's  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2224) really what I care about I don't care  
[0:37:05](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2225) that it's like on a server I only sort  
[0:37:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2228) of care that people are using it but I  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2230) super really care  
[0:37:12](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2232) how it's going for them returning  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2234) metrics so if this talk was too long and  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2238) you read Twitter instead kill staging a  
[0:37:21](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2241) little bit because it's a plausible lie  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2244) and it is leading you to believe things  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2246) that are not true test in production  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2249) because you are anyway and it is true if  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2254) you want a free t-shirt you can take a  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2257) picture of this slide and we will send  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2259) it to you my my team is not forgiving me  
[0:37:43](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2263) yet for doing this in Austria but Italy  
[0:37:46](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2266) it's a lot to ship t-shirts to Austria  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2268) but nice on them and one more and if you  
[0:37:58](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2278) rate the session you get a magical tree  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2280) I'm a little unclear on how this works I  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2282) should probably read the literature but  
[0:38:04](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2284) I think basically if you vote they plant  
[0:38:06](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2286) a tree in your honor and as a carbon  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2288) offset that's pretty cool so you should  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2289) definitely do that alright thank you  
[0:38:13](https://youtu.be/eyvrtU4dYgM?t=2293) [Applause]
