[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=10) and so a bit of background to to this  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=15) talk I I've been RIT for 25 years I'm  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=18) old and gray and miserable and get off  
[0:00:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=20) my lawn but um for about eight of those  
[0:00:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=24) from 2002 to the end of 2009 I was with  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=27) sort works which are they they are  
[0:00:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=30) analysis to the global company every  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=32) time I look there's another thousand  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=33) thought workers having eruption at four  
[0:00:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=35) thousand they'll I kind of taken over  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=37) the world but back then they were not  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=39) much fewer but these guys were real  
[0:00:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=41) pioneers of agile methods and  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=43) particularly bring an agile method into  
[0:00:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=44) large organizations so lots of people  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=46) were doing little bits of agile footwork  
[0:00:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=48) so get much more seriously and said  
[0:00:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=50) we're going to show our large clients  
[0:00:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=52) how we're going to do stuff so I was  
[0:00:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=54) there until about end of 29th end of  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=57) 2009-2010 I left I've been there eight  
[0:00:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=59) years it's time to do something  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=60) different and I joined a very small team  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=63) in a trading firm and the trading firm  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=66) is headquartered here in Chicago I was  
[0:01:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=68) working in the London office so this is  
[0:01:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=69) a bit of a sort of homecoming for this  
[0:01:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=71) talk because a lot of the patterns that  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=73) I'm going to talk about I started  
[0:01:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=74) observing there and then I started  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=76) teaching them and I started noticing  
[0:01:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=77) them in other places as well so while I  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=81) was at the trading firm I I was working  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=83) in a really really weirdly  
[0:01:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=85) high-performing team like there was a  
[0:01:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=87) tiny though there were three people when  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=88) I joined I was number three at its peak  
[0:01:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=90) I think they're about seven people in  
[0:01:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=91) the team so it was never a huge team  
[0:01:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=93) that they were delivering software more  
[0:01:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=97) effectively and more quickly than any  
[0:01:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=99) other team I've ever seen that alone  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=100) worked in and as some weird things  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=105) coming up on the monitor screen down  
[0:01:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=106) here mr. AV person I'm getting some  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=108) tweets and things and rather than that  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=111) so what we'd like to know um  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=115) and now you should see this screen it's  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=117) brilliant it's got little piles of poo  
[0:01:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=118) that say microservices on it's fantastic  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=121) if you haven't seen that slide that  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=123) slide is worth looking for I'm no longer  
[0:02:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=126) going to be distracted by that so anyway  
[0:02:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=128) I started I figured either this is a  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=131) float right and it's like it you know  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=133) you have to have Kent back in the room  
[0:02:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=134) for me it's a chap called Joe warm'd  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=135) who's my favorite programmer I know lots  
[0:02:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=137) of programmers he's the best programmer  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=138) I know but and when he's in a team  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=142) things just work a lot better and so I  
[0:02:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=144) figured maybe that that's the secret is  
[0:02:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=146) have Jaron Athene but then I realized  
[0:02:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=148) this team was doing things that I  
[0:02:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=150) figured I could maybe articulate maybe  
[0:02:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=151) share maybe name as patterns and maybe  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=154) get other people doing as well so that's  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=156) what I've spent about the last five  
[0:02:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=157) years kind of obsessing about and so  
[0:02:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=159) this talk is really is the subset of  
[0:02:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=161) those that is about how teams work and  
[0:02:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=164) Team Dynamics as I usually do I've got  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=168) way too much stuff to fit into the 50  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=170) minutes I've got so I thought I'd start  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=171) by rambling for five minutes and see  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=173) what I get things so at first a word of  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=177) caution okay I'm talking about effective  
[0:03:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=180) teams okay I'm not talking about  
[0:03:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=182) productive teams productive is a massive  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=185) red herring productive comes from the  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=187) Latin Pradera to make and it is the root  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=190) of production product productivity and  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=194) productive and what it means is the  
[0:03:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=197) ability to make lots of the thing okay  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=199) so productive if I have a more  
[0:03:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=201) productive system it produces more stuff  
[0:03:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=204) the goal of software development is not  
[0:03:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=207) to produce stuff the goal of software  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=209) development is to impact a business in  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=212) some way hopefully positively right  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=214) that's what we're about we're not about  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=216) writing software we're about solving  
[0:03:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=218) business problems so effective teams  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=220) managed to solve gnarly business  
[0:03:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=222) problems with tiny tiny bits of software  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=224) if you can solve gnarly business  
[0:03:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=226) problems with no software you win it  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=228) software okay that's how software works  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=230) so where I do not want productive teams  
[0:03:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=233) but do not want productive engineers  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=234) yeah what I want is people who are  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=236) really really good at understanding the  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=238) heart of the problem and just solving  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=240) for that okay that'll pay a lot of money  
[0:04:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=242) for that so I want to talk about  
[0:04:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=244) patterns I'm going to lay them out in  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=246) some sort of form so I figured I would  
[0:04:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=248) put them out on  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=249) a little plane that looks like this with  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=252) difficulty on one axis like how hard is  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=255) it to become good at this thing and  
[0:04:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=256) effectiveness how much will it help you  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=259) on the other axis just for a frame of  
[0:04:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=261) reference the origin and the bottom left  
[0:04:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=263) corner start that quite difficult and  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=265) quite effective ok so what I'm saying by  
[0:04:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=268) that is this these patterns are not for  
[0:04:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=270) beginners well some of them anyway but I  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=273) would argue the patterns aren't for  
[0:04:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=274) beginners anyway ok best practices are  
[0:04:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=276) for beginners follow these rules you'll  
[0:04:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=277) be fine ok once you start to gain a bit  
[0:04:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=279) of context then you start looking at  
[0:04:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=281) patterns so does anybody know what that  
[0:04:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=284) image in the background is I want to  
[0:04:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=287) take a guess where that's from  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=289) it's a map it is a map what's it a map  
[0:04:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=291) of it's a map from the original print of  
[0:04:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=297) Treasure Island I figured it was a  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=299) really really nice idea to have in the  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=301) back of family a little bits of gold in  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=303) here  
[0:05:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=303) I think so so there's that there's a  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=305) little backdrop for you okay the first  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=308) pattern I want to talk about then is I  
[0:05:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=310) think I called Dreyfus squared so in  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=313) order to talk about Dreyfus squared I  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=315) need to first of all talk about the  
[0:05:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=316) Dreyfus model so there's a there are  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=320) many many models of learning of skills  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=322) acquisitions there's xu Hari there's  
[0:05:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=325) conscious competent and all that stuff  
[0:05:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=327) Dreyfus model starts with two brothers  
[0:05:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=329) Hubert in Stuart Dreyfus in the 70s and  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=331) one of them is a systems analyst back  
[0:05:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=336) when we had those things and the other  
[0:05:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=337) ones that philosophers I can imagine  
[0:05:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=338) them at a dinner party and and they got  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=342) together one day and they said wouldn't  
[0:05:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=343) it be cool if you could program a  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=344) computer to learn stuff so like your  
[0:05:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=347) teachers you could learn you can program  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=348) a computer to learn chess and so they  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=351) didn't want a program a chess-playing  
[0:05:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=352) computer that already existed they said  
[0:05:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=354) they wanted to program a computer to  
[0:05:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=356) learn and chess was a sufficiently  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=358) interesting problem because the rules  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=360) aren't very hard but it's really really  
[0:06:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=361) hard to be good at ok so they said this  
[0:06:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=364) is great let's just go find out how  
[0:06:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=365) learning works and then and then we'll  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=366) code it up and they went off and looked  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=369) at how and it turns out now when you  
[0:06:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=370) have learning worked yeah so so being  
[0:06:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=372) being an early pioneers in technology  
[0:06:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=374) they started shaving yaks and they did  
[0:06:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=376) their own research and at the back of  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=378) this research mostly looking at airline  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=380) pilots and how airline  
[0:06:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=381) quite skilled they identified five  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=383) levels of skills acquisition five levels  
[0:06:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=387) of capability you go through on your way  
[0:06:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=389) to deeply deeply learning a skill and so  
[0:06:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=392) here they are at the first level you're  
[0:06:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=394) a novice so you just need rules okay  
[0:06:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=397) don't tell me any of the background just  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=399) tell me what to do I'm learning tennis  
[0:06:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=400) and all I need to know is that I hit the  
[0:06:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=403) round thing with the stick thing okay  
[0:06:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=405) and the surrounding missed it okay no  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=407) and yes I roll at tennis okay there is  
[0:06:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=413) no point of this at this stage telling  
[0:06:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=415) me where my footing is telling me about  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=416) topspin or balance or you have to use  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=419) the court that will just overwhelming  
[0:07:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=421) okay I want to hit the round thing with  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=423) the stick thing a bunch of times and so  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=426) then I do that bunch of times but I'm  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=427) start getting a bit better at hitting  
[0:07:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=429) the round thing with the stick thing and  
[0:07:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=431) so I now move on and I know it's called  
[0:07:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=433) an advanced beginner so advanced  
[0:07:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=435) beginner is where you understand the  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=439) rules and you're trying to wonder out  
[0:07:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=441) you're trying to figure out why those  
[0:07:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=442) are the rules so many many years ago I  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=443) used to do jujitsu martial art and ang  
[0:07:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=446) it so it has lots of tiny little  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=448) economic moves in it so my favorite  
[0:07:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=450) Jitsu move I'll show you it is this this  
[0:07:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=453) is the entire thing okay that right it's  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=458) called cooker Nagi means air technique  
[0:07:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=460) okay  
[0:07:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=461) so that is how you defend yourself when  
[0:07:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=464) someone is swinging a chain at you we  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=470) don't teach that to beginners okay and  
[0:07:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=473) what it does is actually this as the  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=475) change coming round there's a lovely  
[0:07:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=476) point of momentum just here and so you  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=478) put your hands by the side of the  
[0:08:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=480) shoulder and you use it as a pivot so  
[0:08:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=482) I'm doing that the person is moving in a  
[0:08:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=484) big arc like that and they land like a  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=485) sack of sand and the chain lands neatly  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=487) next to them okay you don't learn that  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=490) straightaway but these are the thought  
[0:08:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=493) this is what gypsies got in it apart  
[0:08:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=494) from blocking gypsies blocking is these  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=496) big circular movements like this and I  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=498) just thought that seems really  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=500) unofficial so I'm going to do little  
[0:08:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=502) blocking movement so I did a little  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=503) blocking move it's got smacked in the  
[0:08:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=504) head and that's how I learnt that you do  
[0:08:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=507) big movement okay so that's begin it  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=510) you're testing the rules were breaking  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=512) the rules you're seeing what happens at  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=513) the edges now you start to  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=515) analyze the rules and you become what's  
[0:08:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=517) called competent and at a competent  
[0:08:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=519) level you can now apply the rules to  
[0:08:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=521) achieve a goal so I don't need to tell  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=522) you to take the teabags out and heat the  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=525) kettle and whatever I can just tell you  
[0:08:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=526) I can ask you for a cup of tea could you  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=528) make me a cup of tea please and you say  
[0:08:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=530) certainly would you like milk would you  
[0:08:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=532) like sugar how strong do you like it  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=533) because those are basically the three  
[0:08:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=534) variables okay and so because you  
[0:08:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=537) understand how to apply rules that is as  
[0:08:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=539) far as most people get with most skills  
[0:09:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=541) if you then decide that you want to  
[0:09:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=544) particularly invest in the skill you  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=546) start moving towards the next level  
[0:09:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=547) which is proficient so efficient is now  
[0:09:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=550) where you've really internalized the  
[0:09:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=552) rules and the solution starts up here  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=554) fully formed in your head you start  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=556) having instinct and insight and  
[0:09:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=557) intuition and lots of other things that  
[0:09:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=559) start within okay but you don't trust it  
[0:09:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=562) yet so you kind of fall back on the  
[0:09:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=564) rules right and so so you're still  
[0:09:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=569) learning whether to trust your instinct  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=571) and then eventually again you know you  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=573) you you nerd out about this thing and so  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=576) may be proficient in terms of tea making  
[0:09:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=577) as I start studying different kinds of  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=579) tea in different tea making techniques  
[0:09:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=580) and I learn about how to's made and that  
[0:09:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=583) if you pick the leaves or the buds at  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=584) different points during the age of the  
[0:09:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=587) whatever I don't know I'm not a Tina  
[0:09:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=588) okay  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=589) I'm faking it but eventually you become  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=592) an expert and as an expert transcends  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=596) the rules and this isn't in some  
[0:09:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=597) pretentious hand wavy way this is they  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=599) literally no longer think in rules now  
[0:10:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=602) bear in mind these guys came up with  
[0:10:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=603) this model in the 70s so 40 years ago or  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=607) something recent neuroscience is backing  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=611) this up there's a thing you've got live  
[0:10:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=612) MRI scanning nail so you can watch  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=614) someone's brain activity in real time  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=616) which is kind of cool and one of the  
[0:10:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=619) recent bit of studies that I've heard  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=622) about was studying chess players as  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=625) they're playing chess so when you play  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=628) so the idea that the theory was that  
[0:10:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=630) chess grandmaster just understand how to  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=632) process chess much better than you do  
[0:10:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=634) and if they don't they play differently  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=637) so the way a chess grandmaster plays  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=639) chess is they look at the board the part  
[0:10:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=642) of their brain that's to do with recall  
[0:10:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=644) fires up briefly so that's then  
[0:10:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=646) remembering games that are similar  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=648) so they're falling back on their context  
[0:10:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=650) and then the kind of illogical  
[0:10:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=652) processing parts are now they're  
[0:10:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=653) scanning like this they're scanning that  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=655) space and they're figuring out what to  
[0:10:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=657) do for their move  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=658) meanwhile the not expert chess player  
[0:11:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=660) the intermediate chess player is that  
[0:11:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=662) part is really busy so they're scanning  
[0:11:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=664) a much bigger space so not only is this  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=667) chess grandmaster going to beat you  
[0:11:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=669) they're going to apply less effort doing  
[0:11:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=671) it how annoying is that so thanks for a  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=677) transcendual I got really excited about  
[0:11:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=678) this model because it's based on science  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=680) and I like things that are based on  
[0:11:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=682) science but also it tells me something  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=684) about how people how I can help people  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=686) progress or how people can help  
[0:11:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=688) themselves progress in the context of  
[0:11:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=691) teams then this is a Dreyfus model  
[0:11:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=693) Dreyfus squared so this it says imagine  
[0:11:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=696) you laid these things out as a table you  
[0:11:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=698) don't have to imagine I've laid it out  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=699) as a table for you that's handy isn't it  
[0:11:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=702) and so then we took then we look at what  
[0:11:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=705) happens when we pair up people in a team  
[0:11:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=708) so the new person joins the team and  
[0:11:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=710) what do we tend to do with the new  
[0:11:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=712) person when they join the team we rather  
[0:11:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=716) give them a pile of stuff to read if we  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=718) don't like them yeah or normally what we  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=721) do is we pair them up with neo with the  
[0:12:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=723) expert when we sit okay so that's great  
[0:12:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=725) so we're going to pair you up we're  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=726) going to bring you up to speed so so  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=729) what happens when we pair a novice with  
[0:12:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=731) an expert what do you think happens  
[0:12:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=734) the novice could get overwhelmed yeah  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=739) but remember the expert doesn't think in  
[0:12:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=742) rules anymore they don't it's not that  
[0:12:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=744) they're choosing not to they don't know  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=746) how to okay so what happens when you  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=748) pair a novice with an expert is someone  
[0:12:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=750) dies okay now we don't know which yet  
[0:12:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=756) right either either the novice is  
[0:12:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=759) grabbing the expert by the throat and  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=761) saying tell me what to do or the expert  
[0:12:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=764) is saying if you ask me one more dumb  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=766) question I'm going to kill you okay it  
[0:12:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=769) doesn't end well now remember and I'll  
[0:12:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=772) keep saying this and you'll keep  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=773) forgetting it that's okay I'll keep  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=774) saying it Drake this model is about  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=776) skills not about people so you will have  
[0:12:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=779) a portfolio of skills some of the  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=782) you will be a novice at some of them  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=784) you'll be competent some of them you may  
[0:13:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=785) be an expert in and that will be  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=786) different from someone else's portfolio  
[0:13:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=788) skills so really what this is is an  
[0:13:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=790) overlaying model so when we're thinking  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=792) about pairing people up and watching  
[0:13:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=794) people work this jumps out for me in  
[0:13:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=796) terms of seeing the kinds of disconnects  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=798) I get in communication in teams okay  
[0:13:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=801) what about when I pair up to advanced  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=803) beginners what happens then sorry lots  
[0:13:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=811) of rule-breaking mayhem mayhem incre  
[0:13:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=814) that may have a go it's fantastic right  
[0:13:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=816) there's this huge huge busy learning  
[0:13:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=818) stuff right so it's a really real hotbed  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=821) of like why have you try this and this  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=823) and this so it's a super super  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=824) productive time do not put any of that  
[0:13:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=826) into production okay unless you have a  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=831) sensible adult around to help Shepherd  
[0:13:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=834) this stuff it's a fantastic way to get  
[0:13:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=836) people learning okay let's look at a  
[0:13:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=838) couple more what about when I pet a  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=841) novice and someone competent in that  
[0:14:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=843) skill how does that work that works  
[0:14:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=848) really well so the comp at the competent  
[0:14:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=851) level I'm not aware of things like  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=852) insight and intuition and all those kind  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=854) of things  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=854) I'm still thinking in rules but I'm  
[0:14:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=856) really really good at rules at the  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=858) competent level is typically where  
[0:14:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=859) people write you know the rule books and  
[0:14:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=862) the best practices and the blueprints  
[0:14:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=864) and all that stuff because they think  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=865) the best way to help people is with rule  
[0:14:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=868) what Draper's brothers realize is the  
[0:14:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=872) one thing not to do with someone who's  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=874) an advanced beginner is to try and try  
[0:14:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=876) and help them not mistake and not make  
[0:14:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=878) all the mistakes everyone else makes  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=879) because making mistakes that everyone  
[0:14:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=881) else makes is how you learn right it's  
[0:14:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=883) the process of learning but yes and  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=885) parent knowledge is competent that's  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=886) brilliant so when you get brand-new  
[0:14:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=888) people or someone who's brand-new to a  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=889) domain or a an application or a language  
[0:14:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=892) or whatever else else it is pair them up  
[0:14:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=894) with someone who's okay at it but still  
[0:14:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=897) looking up a load of stuff themselves  
[0:14:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=898) right there's still the goal oriented  
[0:15:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=900) and they understand the rules themselves  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=902) because they will understand the pain  
[0:15:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=904) that the new person is going through and  
[0:15:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=906) they will also be able to speak in a  
[0:15:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=908) language that resonates and the last one  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=910) I want to look at very briefly what  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=913) about one  
[0:15:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=913) here proficient with expert what does  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=917) that look like builds confidence I think  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=922) this is one of the most powerful  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=923) pairings so remember at the proficient  
[0:15:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=925) stage or on your way to proficient  
[0:15:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=927) you've made a choice to invest in a  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=928) thing okay I want to be I want to go  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=931) beyond being a competent JavaScript  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=934) program or to go beyond being a  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=936) competent distributed systems engineer I  
[0:15:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=939) want to really understand how that stuff  
[0:15:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=941) works so I mean I'm expressing a  
[0:15:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=944) investment in intent and then I work  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=947) with an expert who's done that journey  
[0:15:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=949) yeah who's super excited about it and so  
[0:15:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=951) now what you have is it's our comm  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=953) Padawan  
[0:15:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=953) let us spend time right and you go teach  
[0:15:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=956) me the ways and it's brilliant so you  
[0:15:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=958) can completely nerd out on things so so  
[0:16:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=962) why this pattern I find this pattern  
[0:16:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=963) super useful for and again I teach this  
[0:16:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=966) in teams so rather than me saying oh you  
[0:16:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=968) guys should pair together it's let's  
[0:16:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=970) understand how learning works let's  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=972) understand how those different levels of  
[0:16:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=974) skill are likely to collide with each  
[0:16:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=977) other okay and then that means that we  
[0:16:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=980) can start self-selecting into pairings  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=982) for specific situations that are most  
[0:16:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=985) likely to be productive but most likely  
[0:16:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=987) to be valuable and so a bit of meta  
[0:16:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=991) stuff understanding the Dreyfus model is  
[0:16:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=994) a skill oh so now you're all novice  
[0:16:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=999) greatest modelers okay or those of you  
[0:16:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1001) who hadn't come across this before what  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1004) will happen then is you'll become an  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1005) advanced beginner and you'll go this is  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1007) great and you'll start applying it  
[0:16:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1008) everywhere and annoying the crap out of  
[0:16:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1009) people and then and then eventually  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1011) you'll figure out where it works and  
[0:16:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1012) then you'll start to get some balance  
[0:16:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1013) yeah and then you know that they're kind  
[0:16:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1015) of the further stages there are like  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1017) what other learning models either and  
[0:16:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1018) how else can we help people people  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1020) interact with each other so Drake the  
[0:17:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1024) squared then next time I want to look at  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1029) shallow silos this is an example of a  
[0:17:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1033) whole class of things so this isn't  
[0:17:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1035) necessarily go do this it'll work but  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1038) this is the thing that I noticed  
[0:17:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1039) happening in and I'll say this insanely  
[0:17:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1042) high performing team there were about  
[0:17:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1044) six of us by this point and  
[0:17:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1047) the thing I'd always there the mantra I  
[0:17:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1049) heard from from agile land is pair on  
[0:17:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1052) everything right I'm a huge huge amount  
[0:17:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1054) of player programming I'll pair anything  
[0:17:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1056) really pair testing pair analysis and  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1059) they've said pair promiscuously you  
[0:17:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1062) should rotate pairs okay so you should  
[0:17:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1064) pair on lots of different things and  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1065) that way it reduces your truck factor  
[0:17:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1067) you know the number of people that need  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1068) to be run over by a truck I heard  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1070) recently of a thing called the inverse  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1072) truck factor the inverse truck factor is  
[0:17:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1075) the number of people in your team that  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1077) need to get run over before we can get  
[0:17:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1079) any work done most teams most teams have  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1085) a non zero truck factor has been my  
[0:18:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1087) experience okay so I'm anything and what  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1091) what we noticed was this is as a team we  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1094) were super super effective we were able  
[0:18:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1095) to iterate on ideas very quickly we had  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1097) fantastic rapport and communication with  
[0:18:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1099) the traders were building trading  
[0:18:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1100) systems were embedded in with the  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1101) traders and but what would happen if  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1106) people had different propensity so there  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1108) were a couple of people who were really  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1110) into the domain of trading and what does  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1112) it mean to write effective algorithms  
[0:18:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1113) and and all that kind of stuff there are  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1116) people who are like like me I'm really  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1118) into how things connect up so almost  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1120) like that it didn't need to be a trading  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1122) firm it could have been a health care  
[0:18:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1123) firm or a retail firm I care about  
[0:18:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1125) systems integration and wiring things  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1127) off and having messages flying around  
[0:18:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1128) the place and all that kind of thing  
[0:18:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1130) and then you get people who nerd out on  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1132) your user experience and usability and  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1135) so what we have was a very complicated  
[0:18:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1137) technology trading stack weird lots of  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1140) bits in it and people tended to kind of  
[0:19:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1141) prefer different areas and so the order  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1145) management system in a trading in a  
[0:19:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1147) trading stack I won't go into it but  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1148) it's a very very complicated bit of  
[0:19:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1149) software it's it is quite simple to  
[0:19:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1152) describe but there's enormous Lee  
[0:19:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1154) complex emergent behavior in it I I  
[0:19:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1156) tried building an OMS and on a  
[0:19:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1158) management system a couple of times my  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1160) head exploded and then I got someone  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1162) else my head didn't explode anymore  
[0:19:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1164) which is great and then there are some  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1166) things I shouldn't try to do so but what  
[0:19:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1169) we found is that essentially in the team  
[0:19:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1171) the six people tended to fall into three  
[0:19:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1174) pairs that would focus on different  
[0:19:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1176) areas and so we should rotate people so  
[0:19:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1179) we started rotating people and  
[0:19:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1181) what I have only Europe rotate people is  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1182) people just going to move I mean I can  
[0:19:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1185) do this stuff I'm not that interested in  
[0:19:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1187) it I'd rather do that thing over there  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1188) and when you get people who are doing  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1190) work that is like new look the work that  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1193) comes out is a bit okay it projects okay  
[0:19:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1198) it's a transference thing and so if you  
[0:20:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1200) get someone working on something that  
[0:20:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1201) they're really excited about they tend  
[0:20:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1203) to get something really good at the  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1204) other end so we said let's not overthink  
[0:20:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1206) this  
[0:20:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1207) what would is will stay in our  
[0:20:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1209) effectively silos right so there's these  
[0:20:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1211) two expert in here and these two the  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1213) expert in this thing at these two the  
[0:20:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1213) expert in this thing but as a team we  
[0:20:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1216) would have stand up session here to  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1218) stand ups every day I talk about stand  
[0:20:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1220) ups in a minute but have to stand ups  
[0:20:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1222) every day and what would happen is the  
[0:20:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1224) silent was only about this height okay I  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1227) don't account for your knees so it would  
[0:20:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1229) be an outsider then we'd come out of our  
[0:20:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1230) silo and come and have a team you know  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1233) stand up and then we come back into that  
[0:20:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1234) little silo and then do work and that  
[0:20:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1237) turned out to work really well so  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1240) shallow silos is an example of a  
[0:20:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1242) different kind of team set up in terms  
[0:20:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1244) of how we allocate work and how we  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1245) manage work and how we consume work is a  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1249) lotof and particularly the agile space I  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1251) see this and I don't know why things are  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1253) presented as binary you know you're  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1255) you're using story points you're not  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1257) using story point you're doing  
[0:20:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1258) estimating you're not doing estimating  
[0:21:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1260) so there's no estimate thing is like you  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1262) know it's like binary estimate no  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1263) estimates those are your two choices  
[0:21:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1265) whereas generally a lot of these things  
[0:21:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1267) are much more nuanced and so the way we  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1269) allocate and consume work in a team is  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1271) much more nuanced than what we're  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1273) pairing and we're rotating and we have  
[0:21:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1274) pare stairs and one of rails or people  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1277) take individual work and then they're  
[0:21:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1278) allocated into silos yeah so shallow  
[0:21:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1282) silos an example of somewhere along that  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1285) spectrum there are many others and what  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1288) could go into a few of them today but  
[0:21:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1289) I've got lots more to talk about so just  
[0:21:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1291) bear in mind if you're in a team and  
[0:21:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1292) you're thinking well some people really  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1294) love doing web development  
[0:21:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1296) okay do you know what set them up so  
[0:21:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1298) they can do excellent web development  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1299) give them all the support they need as  
[0:21:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1301) long as more than one person knows a  
[0:21:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1303) thing then people can take vacation  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1305) safely people can rotate in and out of  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1308) the team that's okay  
[0:21:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1309) all right so I'm an obsessive about  
[0:21:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1311) pairing but I'm much much more relaxed  
[0:21:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1313) now about  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1314) rotating people through different kinds  
[0:21:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1316) of work so that's looking at a specific  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1320) team now let's look at interactions  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1323) between teams so one of the challenges  
[0:22:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1329) we had at the trading firm I was in this  
[0:22:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1330) team for about a year and after about a  
[0:22:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1332) year I changed wrong so I switched into  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1334) the motor I was now pairing with the CIO  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1337) on essentially an all change journey so  
[0:22:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1340) about a year and a half it was really  
[0:22:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1341) really really fun time and he's here so  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1345) I've got to be very careful what I say  
[0:22:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1346) cuz he's in close enough to three things  
[0:22:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1349) so one of the things we found we're  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1352) really struggling with was people were  
[0:22:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1354) basically working in vertical areas so  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1357) what happened before was like there was  
[0:22:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1359) just no you know no control if you like  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1361) so they were kind of fires everywhere  
[0:22:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1362) and so he'd come in it's a driver going  
[0:22:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1364) to be the head of networking a head  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1365) event infrastructure a head of data  
[0:22:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1367) center there's going to be a bunch of  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1368) heads of things so that then is going to  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1370) be responsibility and accountability and  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1372) all the fires Pennell it was brilliant  
[0:22:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1375) right that's the right thing to do but  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1376) then we've got the problem that now  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1378) everything is handoffs and so now how do  
[0:22:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1379) we make work flow through the  
[0:23:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1381) organization so we went from no  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1382) structure to structure and now we wanted  
[0:23:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1384) to get more kind of link so it's okay  
[0:23:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1388) how should we then how should the  
[0:23:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1391) delivery team so the team that's  
[0:23:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1393) building a product for building a  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1394) trading system how should they interact  
[0:23:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1396) with Network specialists right network  
[0:23:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1399) engineers and we sort of thought will  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1401) make you know we could do these  
[0:23:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1401) cross-functional teams and when you're  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1404) working at that kind of level you have  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1406) network engineers who have literally all  
[0:23:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1407) they've done for 20 years is nerded out  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1410) on different switches right they can  
[0:23:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1412) tell you everything about every Rev of  
[0:23:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1414) every upgrade of every make of switch  
[0:23:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1416) that they've ever seen  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1417) and they can tell you about all I learnt  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1419) some mad stuff store and for fat versus  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1422) pass-through so this is as the bikes for  
[0:23:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1424) a packet arrived at a switch do you wait  
[0:23:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1426) until you've got the hot packet and then  
[0:23:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1427) send it on its way which means you get  
[0:23:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1429) more reliable packets because if you get  
[0:23:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1431) a partial packet you don't then send it  
[0:23:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1433) on or do you send it through a byte at a  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1435) time as you get it because that means  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1437) you get faster throughput lower latency  
[0:23:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1439) but if you get a fragmented packet so  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1441) does everyone else  
[0:24:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1441) yeah neither one of those is right as  
[0:24:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1444) parting says it depends there's  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1445) different cases for different situations  
[0:24:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1447) and I learnt all this stuff working with  
[0:24:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1449) these Network guys ask one of these  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1450) network guys if they want to build a  
[0:24:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1451) webpage  
[0:24:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1453) yeah no I'll Sonny's Network guys what  
[0:24:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1457) they think about CSS that's their CSS  
[0:24:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1461) care face right and so it doesn't work  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1464) just a nice build cross-functional teams  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1466) so I stole a model that I've seen is  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1469) company called object mental about a  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1470) hundred years ago early agile very early  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1472) agile ponies I've got some they've got  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1475) some great online legal folks like  
[0:24:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1476) Michael feathers and Bob Martha's work  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1478) there and they had a coaching model  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1481) where they would have individual coaches  
[0:24:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1482) would be on assignment but they  
[0:24:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1484) typically went out individually but they  
[0:24:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1486) would be buddied up with someone who  
[0:24:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1488) wasn't there okay just to keep them sane  
[0:24:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1491) so they're checking with them every week  
[0:24:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1492) or so now how you doing and they called  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1494) it near coaching and fire coaching so  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1496) the near coach is embedded in the team  
[0:24:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1497) the fire coaches is a little bit away  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1499) and it wasn't a senior junior thing so  
[0:25:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1502) you could reasonably be each other's  
[0:25:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1504) near and far coaches yeah but what it  
[0:25:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1507) meant was that you had someone with a  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1508) different perspective and I thought this  
[0:25:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1510) was a really powerful model so we  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1511) started doing something like this so for  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1514) those specialist teams and we didn't  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1516) call them expert team because everyone's  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1518) experts at those different things ago  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1520) Draper's right but these are specialists  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1521) in things like infrastructure datacenter  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1523) DBAs whatever it might be and within  
[0:25:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1526) those little groups and they're only  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1527) little groups maybe four or five of each  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1530) you had the kinds of people who loved  
[0:25:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1533) being in teams and helping a team build  
[0:25:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1536) a product and the kind of people who  
[0:25:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1537) loved just nerding out in their  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1539) discipline but for the DBA the lead DBA  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1542) had literally written books about Oracle  
[0:25:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1544) DBA Inge yeah she was awesome and so  
[0:25:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1548) we've started building this model where  
[0:25:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1550) you would have embedded people in the  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1552) teams and they would have a kind of like  
[0:25:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1555) they'd be like a mothership they'd go  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1557) back to and the mother ships job was to  
[0:25:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1558) stay current and to learn stuff and to  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1560) be ahead of the game and the guys  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1562) embedded in the team's their job was to  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1564) implement those ideas for the particular  
[0:26:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1567) people but there was like a secondary  
[0:26:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1569) role which is they were coaching the  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1571) teams so if I needed something network  
[0:26:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1573) expertise we get the net one at one of  
[0:26:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1575) the roving Network people come and sit  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1576) in our team and they'd be connected back  
[0:26:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1578) to the gang of court hard core  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1580) networking people  
[0:26:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1581) and they will be teaching us what we  
[0:26:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1583) needed as they were doing it so again  
[0:26:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1585) pairing right and so as they're teaching  
[0:26:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1587) and we're doing it  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1588) our team is now learning enough about  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1590) networking to be dangerous  
[0:26:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1591) yeah and that meant that next time we  
[0:26:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1593) needed them slightly less so they're  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1595) raising the bar across all of these  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1597) different disciplines and skills so as I  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1599) say that DBA is right tuning a database  
[0:26:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1602) is something you don't need until you  
[0:26:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1603) need it and then you really need it a  
[0:26:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1605) lot and then you don't need it again for  
[0:26:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1606) ages it doesn't make sense to have an  
[0:26:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1608) embedded DBA in a team so we ended up  
[0:26:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1610) with this model where people kind of  
[0:26:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1612) start in though they were in like a core  
[0:26:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1614) team I'm gonna go out on assignments to  
[0:26:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1616) different teams and help out and then  
[0:26:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1618) they come back and share knowledge that  
[0:27:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1620) way which we found to be useful  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1624) this was warm welcome it was and this is  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1629) something you can all do tomorrow well  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1631) not tomorrow you'll be here right but  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1633) you can all do very very easily  
[0:27:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1637) sometimes the barrier to this is  
[0:27:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1640) organizational stuff in fact most often  
[0:27:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1642) the barriers organizational stuff a warm  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1644) welcome is it when someone joins the  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1647) team that is your one and only time to  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1649) make one of any opportunity to make a  
[0:27:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1651) good first impression okay so what was  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1655) your first impression like when you  
[0:27:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1656) joined the team or when you joined the  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1658) company you rocked up and they weren't  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1660) expecting you rocked up and you didn't  
[0:27:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1661) have a desk you rocks happen it took you  
[0:27:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1663) know ten days before you could even log  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1665) in right so warm welcome is this is  
[0:27:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1670) really really it got hard really really  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1673) caring about the fact that someone's  
[0:27:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1675) about to join a team or someone's about  
[0:27:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1677) more importantly towards that to join an  
[0:27:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1678) organization and laying out the red  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1681) carpet making them really really special  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1684) like you actually want them to be there  
[0:28:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1686) okay this is not a difficult thing to do  
[0:28:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1688) so my example of this was a couple of  
[0:28:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1693) weeks before I joined this company I got  
[0:28:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1695) a phone call saying you're joining a  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1697) couple of weeks yes I am what laptop do  
[0:28:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1698) you want oh no profs me that what can I  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1702) have no one laptops you want anything  
[0:28:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1706) right you know my laptop and we're going  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1708) Oh not ready for this question and we  
[0:28:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1712) chatted a bit line it up then I asking  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1713) for  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1714) a pretty spiffy laptop anyway so I  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1716) turned up on day one and there's my  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1718) laptop on my desk and there is a  
[0:28:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1721) unbelievably kick-ass state-of-the-art  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1723) developer workstation as well two  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1725) massive screens and and there's my login  
[0:28:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1729) and my password on a post-it on the desk  
[0:28:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1732) um and and they said okay so go right so  
[0:28:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1735) I logged in and up comes my mail client  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1738) and in my inbox I've got one email it is  
[0:29:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1740) welcome and I click on it and there's a  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1742) link to a wiki page and I click on the  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1744) link to the wiki pages is welcome Dan so  
[0:29:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1747) here's some things you're probably what  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1748) I'm going to want to do on day one and  
[0:29:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1749) it's a list of things and most of the  
[0:29:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1752) list was people I was going to need to  
[0:29:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1753) meet you're going to need to meet this  
[0:29:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1755) lady because she does with holidays  
[0:29:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1756) you'll need to meet this guy because he  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1757) does desktop support and you know these  
[0:29:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1759) are some people some traders that you're  
[0:29:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1761) going to want to talk to and as I'm  
[0:29:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1762) going down one of the things was if  
[0:29:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1763) these things seem like they're in the  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1764) wrong order  
[0:29:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1765) change the order oh okay yeah I can do  
[0:29:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1768) that to wiki page and then the very last  
[0:29:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1770) thing said find out who's joining next  
[0:29:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1773) and changed the name at the top right  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1775) okay so now the next guy in it was a  
[0:29:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1779) chap called Neil and so he came in on  
[0:29:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1781) his day one it says welcome Neil and it  
[0:29:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1784) is last updated by Dan so there he knows  
[0:29:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1787) who the most recent person was right  
[0:29:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1789) really where this cost me nothing this  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1791) costs exactly nothing to build yeah I  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1794) felt so welcomed and so once you feel  
[0:29:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1798) that you want to pay that forward and  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1799) it's a very very actually look at this  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1802) it's so not difficult at all and it's  
[0:30:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1804) super be effective yeah it makes a  
[0:30:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1807) massive impact because now everyone in  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1808) that team has been welcomed in that way  
[0:30:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1810) there's a corresponding pattern about  
[0:30:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1812) when someone leaves the team you know  
[0:30:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1813) have a fond farewell but I thought I was  
[0:30:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1816) going all by then by Marcin thanks for  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1817) coming I was great it's like you know  
[0:30:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1819) let's celebrate you know the work you've  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1821) done and what you've contributed and  
[0:30:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1822) let's wish you well on your next thing  
[0:30:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1823) and all that kind of stuff ok very  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1826) important who here has a stand up who  
[0:30:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1833) doesn't stand ups most of the hands in  
[0:30:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1835) the room ok whose stand up looks like  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1838) this yesterday I did this today I'm  
[0:30:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1842) doing this I haven't got any blockers  
[0:30:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1844) yesterday I did this today I'm doing it  
[0:30:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1847) everybody blockers  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1849) just about it about half and okay so I  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1855) think we've largely missed the point of  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1858) stand ups so stand up  
[0:31:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1860) generally they became and again it's  
[0:31:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1862) looking at the history right so the  
[0:31:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1863) history of stand ups is this is we used  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1866) to have steering okay back in the days  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1869) when I would spend am I going to do  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1871) release every eighteen months whether i  
[0:31:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1873) need to or not yeah and we'd probably  
[0:31:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1876) have monthly steering in that monthly  
[0:31:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1877) steering we don't beat each other up or  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1879) whatever you do I have a monthly  
[0:31:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1879) steering then people like my team  
[0:31:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1883) divorce is saying okay we're going to  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1884) start releasing things in twelve weeks  
[0:31:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1885) right not twelve months twelve weeks  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1888) we're going to release something in  
[0:31:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1889) twelve weeks  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1890) I'm not going to fly blind for twelve  
[0:31:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1891) weeks we're going to sprint to half way  
[0:31:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1892) six weeks and we're going to sprint for  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1894) another six weeks and then we're going  
[0:31:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1895) to know so that's how the idea of  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1897) Sprint's came from whether it was six  
[0:31:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1898) weeks of work and the goal was to be  
[0:31:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1901) able to once a season  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1902) okay that was considered impossible it  
[0:31:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1904) isn't have been anointed and so what's  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1907) happening is this is I'm now I'm not  
[0:31:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1909) I've got this six week period where I  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1911) have to have something to show at the  
[0:31:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1912) end of it well if we still do our  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1913) monthly steering then I'm probably going  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1916) to have one if I'm lucky I'll get two of  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1917) those in that six weeks that's a bit  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1919) rubbish right what if I did weekly  
[0:32:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1921) steering well even then that's six data  
[0:32:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1923) points I have my six week period  
[0:32:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1924) so what I'd probably want to do is go to  
[0:32:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1926) almost daily steering so that's what  
[0:32:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1928) your stand-up is it's a coordination  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1930) exercise at the beginning of the day so  
[0:32:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1935) the coaching I give or the advice I give  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1938) teams and the advice I try and use  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1939) myself is this is think of the  
[0:32:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1943) huddle if you like the stand-up it's  
[0:32:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1946) like in a game of american football or  
[0:32:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1948) we're here so I going to say football  
[0:32:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1949) right so you have four downs okay you  
[0:32:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1952) have four goes to get ten yards right  
[0:32:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1955) and for each of those ahead of each of  
[0:32:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1958) those goes will huddle and we have a  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1960) conversation and the conversation is  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1962) literally what are we going to do for  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1964) the next down because as soon as we do  
[0:32:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1965) the next down well have another  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1967) conversation yeah it's a very very  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1969) short-term planning exercise but are you  
[0:32:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1972) have how's the missus really oh okay  
[0:32:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1974) nice and the kids at school yeah great  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1975) but no and it's not okay just in that  
[0:32:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1979) last thing you pass really badly I think  
[0:33:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1980) you should know that  
[0:33:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1981) okay and I'm going to measure your  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1982) passing no it's not it's right we need  
[0:33:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1984) to go forward and how we're going to do  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1986) that yeah we don't use this for beating  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1988) each other up we don't use this for for  
[0:33:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1990) status it's not a serial status meeting  
[0:33:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1992) it's a guiding meeting so one of my  
[0:33:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=1997) favorite movies Dead Poets Society so  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2002) Robin Williams between like amazing and  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2005) really schmaltzy and this is I think  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2007) this is him amazing and he's a teacher  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2009) in a school and is he's a really  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2011) unconventional teacher it's a very very  
[0:33:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2013) stiff boring school and he's outrage of  
[0:33:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2016) character and so and he gets all of all  
[0:33:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2019) his pupils all these boys and he says  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2020) right boys you need to carpe diem you  
[0:33:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2023) need to seize the day okay every single  
[0:33:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2026) day treat every single day like it's

[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2036) asking ourselves is one question what is  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2038) the best possible today we can have okay  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2042) that's the whole thing what's the best

[0:34:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2050) set up another build server yesterday so  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2052) the build should start going a bit  
[0:34:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2053) faster and but you might still get any  
[0:34:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2055) emails from a different host but don't

[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2062) day better but literally the entire  
[0:34:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2064) point of the stand up is what's the best  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2068) possible today we can have weather where

[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2082) T boy but his T - oh I like a skater  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2086) name right because he's cool  
[0:34:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2090) he's the least t-boy person you've ever  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2093) seen however what he would do is this is  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2097) every afternoon he would wander round  
[0:34:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2099) then he had a little post-it and he  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2101) can't buy any say hey I know can I get  
[0:35:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2104) you a cup of tea so yeah please every  
[0:35:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2106) nothing okay what would you like maybe  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2109) yep sure hey getting on I'm just and  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2112) what he's actually doing when he's going  
[0:35:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2114) round from desk to desk is this yes sure  
[0:35:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2116) he's taking the tea orders he's also  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2118) checking in on everybody that's where he  
[0:35:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2120) picks up status okay so it's less  
[0:35:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2124) efficient for him but much more  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2126) efficient but much more effective for  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2128) the team because now I'm seeing someone  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2130) where they are you know if Martin's  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2133) having a crappy day he's not gonna come  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2135) first and off go I'm having a crappy  
[0:35:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2136) eternity but I'll sense it right I'll go  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2138) to where he's sitting and he's clearly  
[0:35:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2139) down he's clearly not his normal  
[0:35:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2141) energized bubbly self and so you know  
[0:35:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2145) and I'm aware of that I can read that  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2146) without even having any words but then I  
[0:35:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2148) can say what you're up to  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2149) I'm struggling with this thing okay one  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2150) minute now I know that that's the thing  
[0:35:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2152) that's being struggled with okay so what  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2154) he would do then he goes right and of  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2156) course then he brings the tea I thought  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2157) it only worked once  
[0:35:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2158) yeah and and so each day he come a bring  
[0:36:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2161) the tea and then so he would start the  
[0:36:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2164) stand-up with this I mean it was always  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2165) against the board so the you know the  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2167) wall because then that's where that's  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2168) where the work is so we don't we don't  
[0:36:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2170) care about whether it do status of  
[0:36:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2172) people right I'm not your mum and I'm  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2174) not a policeman so that's okay I trust  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2176) that you're going to do good work we  
[0:36:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2177) hired smart people and we trust them  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2178) what we're looking at is which work is  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2181) moving and so he would start the stand  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2183) up with and it was never more than two  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2185) minutes complete update on the state of  
[0:36:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2187) the world and so now the whole team is  
[0:36:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2190) like right we know exactly where we are  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2191) and this was quite a big team it's about  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2192) ten people living and within two minutes  
[0:36:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2195) everyone knew everyone was so that was  
[0:36:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2197) the meta message there was I don't care  
[0:36:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2199) about status or rather you don't need to  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2201) now report status let's now have a  
[0:36:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2203) standoff about where we want to go today  
[0:36:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2204) and it was a really powerful thing and I  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2208) think ken Shriver is being misunderstood  
[0:36:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2211) I don't have data for this but I have a  
[0:36:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2212) sense of this so these three questions  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2215) what did you do yesterday what are you  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2217) doing today and are you blocked right  
[0:37:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2220) these are the three standards stand up  
[0:37:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2222) questions right he's using those sorts  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2224) questions it's kind of close yeah loads  
[0:37:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2226) of people okay unfortunately you're  
[0:37:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2229) totally missing the point  
[0:37:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2230) I do apologize the questions are this  
[0:37:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2234) what work items moved yesterday what  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2239) work items are likely to move today what  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2242) were customs are blocked people are  
[0:37:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2245) never blocked right if in doubt context  
[0:37:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2247) switch if you worried about which  
[0:37:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2249) context to switch between have a meeting  
[0:37:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2251) right you lonely at work have more  
[0:37:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2253) meetings yeah so people don't get  
[0:37:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2257) blocked at work gets blocked and so done  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2260) right at some talks vanity says you  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2262) don't measure the workers you measure  
[0:37:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2264) the work items we're measuring the flow  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2265) of work through a system and so the  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2268) reason to ask what work moved yesterday  
[0:37:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2270) is I want all the work to be flowing  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2273) through the system and so if there's  
[0:37:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2274) things that we thought will work in  
[0:37:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2275) process but you know what they're not  
[0:37:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2277) being worked on yeah  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2279) then they're not working process they're  
[0:38:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2280) blocked stuck work that's just ticking  
[0:38:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2282) away the clock's ticking which we should  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2285) probably be aware of as a team because  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2287) now we're making commitments if we can't  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2288) follow through  
[0:38:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2289) it's only how we're going to do this it  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2290) can be fine so what worked me yesterday  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2294) what work should I expect to see moving  
[0:38:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2297) today because if it isn't that signal  
[0:38:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2299) and we can go after that and what work  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2301) is blocked because now we can go in and  
[0:38:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2303) start on blocking things so who likes  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2310) code reviews oh few hands who does code  
[0:38:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2313) reviews lots more hands so from that I  
[0:38:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2317) surmised the they're putting a lot of  
[0:38:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2322) code reviews and not actually not not at  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2324) having much fun so I used to be of the  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2328) opinion that if you're doing pairing and  
[0:38:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2331) you're pairing well we're pairing  
[0:38:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2332) effectively that you don't really need  
[0:38:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2334) code reviews because the code quality  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2336) kind of looks after itself I have  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2338) changed that opinion I think code  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2340) reviews provide a substantive lis  
[0:39:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2343) different thing from just the rigor and  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2347) discipline you get from hearing so I've  
[0:39:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2349) introduced its own code critique most  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2351) because it's a different word for like  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2353) knowledge crunching that Erica Evans  
[0:39:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2355) uses is basically analysis but when you  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2357) say analysis everywhere  
[0:39:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2358) when you take code review everyone good  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2360) to know so code critique is like think  
[0:39:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2362) like a film critic and I think I go  
[0:39:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2363) describe a movie and if if you like the  
[0:39:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2365) kind of movies they like and they like  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2367) this movie you'll probably like it too  
[0:39:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2368) it's that kind of thing so code critique  
[0:39:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2371) we started doing this and again this  
[0:39:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2373) happened at the trading firm one day  
[0:39:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2375) this just happened and I just stuck with  
[0:39:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2376) me a really really resonated there was a  
[0:39:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2379) bunch of people who've been doing work  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2380) and it's still only a small team but a  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2382) small team can cover a lot of ground  
[0:39:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2383) very quickly when they're when they're  
[0:39:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2386) allowed to and this chap Neil who is a  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2389) team lead at this point here used to he  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2392) used to watch the get commit going in  
[0:39:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2393) he'd watch the room and a little thing  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2396) that would pop up in his in his window  
[0:39:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2397) that would show the get commit he wasn't  
[0:39:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2399) policing people he was just curious okay  
[0:40:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2401) and when he's looking for his patterns  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2403) in that and so um so one day he noticed  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2407) that three of us had been working on  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2409) what was ostensibly similar stuff and  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2411) hadn't noticed even though we're having  
[0:40:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2412) like loads of stand-ups and loads of  
[0:40:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2414) coordination it's still possible for  
[0:40:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2416) things to fall through the cracks he  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2417) said no we're doing the same thing in  
[0:40:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2419) different places let's look at all of  
[0:40:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2421) them as a team and see what we think so  
[0:40:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2423) we got a projector and put all of them  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2424) up one after the other and it wasn't  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2427) this is good or this is bad it was one  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2429) of the trade-offs with you know solution  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2431) one solution two solution three what why  
[0:40:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2433) did you choose that what choices did you  
[0:40:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2435) make what things did you discard I can  
[0:40:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2438) see the coat I can coat review code  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2439) really easily just by looking at the  
[0:40:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2442) code well I can't see when I look at  
[0:40:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2443) code is the code that isn't there right  
[0:40:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2446) what I can't see is that you know Adrian  
[0:40:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2449) went through five different ideas before  
[0:40:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2452) this one okay and this is the one that's  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2454) under version control and that's great  
[0:40:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2455) but he's sketching with code and if I  
[0:40:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2458) want to learn to program like he does I  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2460) missed that  
[0:41:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2461) and so what we did is we put them up one  
[0:41:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2464) at a time and we decided that actually  
[0:41:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2465) one of them worked really really well  
[0:41:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2467) for sketching things for doing things  
[0:41:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2468) quickly but it had some odd behavioral  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2471) characteristic so don't stress it and  
[0:41:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2472) one of them was really really robust but  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2474) probably took a bit more work so don't  
[0:41:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2476) use that for sketching because you can't  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2477) sketch as fast yeah and so we learnt  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2480) different things and what that does is  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2481) it creates across the team idioms  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2484) okay so idioms are they're a language  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2488) construct an idiom is  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2491) a turn of phrase that happens to be  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2494) there okay but it's one that we all  
[0:41:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2496) choose means the same thing let me give  
[0:41:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2499) an example my favorite idiom is if you  
[0:41:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2502) come from Devon in England there's a  
[0:41:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2504) word that means someone who doesn't come  
[0:41:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2506) from Devon okay there's a word drakul  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2509) okay so a gronckle actually what a  
[0:41:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2512) grokken is is anyone who doesn't know  
[0:41:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2514) what a drakul is okay so a gronckle is  
[0:41:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2517) someone who's not from around here the  
[0:41:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2519) very neighboring County some of it has a  
[0:42:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2522) word for someone who's not from around  
[0:42:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2524) here and that word is in it  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2527) okay these are both made up with there  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2531) is no etymology to these things right so  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2534) but the great thing is that and that is  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2536) that that's idiomatic now when you get a  
[0:42:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2538) massive language like scarlet a scarlet  
[0:42:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2542) is the least opinionated language in the  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2544) world so what about code reuse scarlet  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2546) so well you've got class-based  
[0:42:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2547) inheritance you've got mix ins you've  
[0:42:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2549) got a closure over over code over  
[0:42:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2554) functions you've got a you goes  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2555) yeah sure what do you mean yes sure yeah  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2557) we do all of those but okay what about  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2560) like I know something like working  
[0:42:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2562) producing a sequence of values so yes so  
[0:42:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2565) frozen signal values we can have a for  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2566) loop we can have iterator we could have  
[0:42:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2570) functional like MapReduce and we can  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2572) have recursion and Scala goes yeah yeah  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2575) we like all of those yeah brilliant so  
[0:42:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2578) now if I have a code base with more than  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2579) four developers in it how many of those  
[0:43:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2582) are more likely to find not just all of  
[0:43:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2586) them combinations of them I'm going to  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2589) get a for loop with an iterator that  
[0:43:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2591) contains a MapReduce because why not  
[0:43:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2592) yeah and and so what that means is it  
[0:43:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2596) becomes really hard as high cognitive  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2598) load looking at different people's code  
[0:43:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2600) and so what we need is some sense of  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2603) what good looks like here because  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2606) there's lots and lots of values of good  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2607) someone like closure is a much more  
[0:43:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2609) opinionated language it's lit its parens  
[0:43:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2611) that's most of the language yeah  
[0:43:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2614) so when you see idiomatic closure then  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2618) you know most closures of idiomatic  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2619) right Python is a good that there's a  
[0:43:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2622) word pythonic which means  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2625) code written like Python programmers  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2626) right there is no Scala ik that's not a  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2629) coincidence  
[0:43:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2629) yeah and so what you use a code critique  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2633) for is to create those idioms to agree  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2635) what we think good looks like around  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2637) here and so then if I see something that  
[0:43:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2639) isn't that it's probably for a specific  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2642) case so if we decide that we're going to  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2644) go with and I Map Reduce type functional  
[0:44:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2648) expressions for working through for  
[0:44:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2650) processing sequences and I find a for  
[0:44:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2652) loop the chances are that for loop is  
[0:44:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2654) doing something low-latency right  
[0:44:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2656) because for loops are faster than  
[0:44:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2657) folding but I'm making this up right it  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2660) might not be the case but if that could  
[0:44:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2661) be the case but the idea is that once  
[0:44:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2663) we've got this idea of what what  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2665) idiomatic looks like for this code base  
[0:44:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2667) when I see something unusual its signal  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2670) okay so a really powerful model for code  
[0:44:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2674) critique is to have junior people or  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2676) less experienced people critiquing more  
[0:44:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2678) experienced people's code fool there's a  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2684) couple of reasons for this they ask  
[0:44:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2685) really good questions like they ask  
[0:44:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2687) questions like why did you do that and  
[0:44:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2689) their intent with the why did you do  
[0:44:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2692) that is explain to me why you did that  
[0:44:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2693) the effect of them saying why did you do  
[0:44:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2695) that is oh my goodness that's a really  
[0:45:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2701) good question they go with it oh okay  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2703) that's great yeah now we should never  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2706) have done that okay but what it does is  
[0:45:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2708) it allows these idioms to emerge in a  
[0:45:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2710) safe environment  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2712) okay and so again you know as a junior  
[0:45:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2714) as a junior in this system or in this  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2716) application I can say our Adrian with  
[0:45:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2718) your massive brain and your brilliant  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2719) coding skills right you've done this  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2721) thing that I would never have thought of  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2723) why did you do that what other things  
[0:45:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2725) did you discard on the way through that  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2727) because now I can learn to do those  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2729) things too and that would be cool so  
[0:45:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2733) what's the message here use code petites  
[0:45:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2736) use code reviews there are really  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2737) powerful tool don't use them to police  
[0:45:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2739) people okay that's an unfair thing to do  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2743) and it will create perverse incentives  
[0:45:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2746) as well right  
[0:45:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2747) and it's also typically what you're  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2748) doing is critiquing something after the  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2750) fact so it's all like some cost as well  
[0:45:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2752) which is which is annoying so use a code  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2755) critique as a way for the team to align  
[0:45:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2756) for the team to agree idioms  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2759) and again you can start to see these  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2760) patterns start to combine you can use  
[0:46:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2762) code critique as part of a warm welcome  
[0:46:04](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2764) you know hey I know welcome to the team  
[0:46:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2766) we're about to look at some code come  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2768) and look at it with us  
[0:46:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2769) you know you've not seen this  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2770) application before you've not seen this  
[0:46:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2771) code beta for what do you think and what  
[0:46:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2774) have you learned elsewhere and so she's  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2775) bringing her knowledge into that team as  
[0:46:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2777) well last one I want to look at then is  
[0:46:20](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2780) a hack day I'm sure he's had hack days  
[0:46:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2782) is yeah brilliant  
[0:46:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2784) loads of people these are really good  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2786) fun this is not a hackathon this is not  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2789) let's throw off all the traces and and  
[0:46:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2790) that's let's have some a hack day though  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2793) is it's a day where we're not going to  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2795) do regular day job but it's a day with a  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2798) theme so I heard about these through  
[0:46:39](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2799) Google a lot of organizations have them  
[0:46:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2803) so you'll have a hack day with a theme  
[0:46:44](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2804) so we've had bug crushing days right and  
[0:46:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2808) on bug crushing days we just go after  
[0:46:50](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2810) the bugs yeah and we pair up when we go  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2812) and kill the bugs we might have a hack  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2814) day around true clip let's all just  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2817) forget what we're doing we're going to  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2819) spend an entire day everyone is going to  
[0:47:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2821) make this thing faster for any value of  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2823) faster okay so you get the whole team  
[0:47:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2827) pointing in the same direction or the  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2828) whole organization get a bunch of teams  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2831) all points in the same direction it's a  
[0:47:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2832) super high energized thing and a super  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2834) fun thing to do and people think about  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2837) this particularly sort of middle senior  
[0:47:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2839) managers go all that's wasteful they're  
[0:47:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2841) off they're not doing their regular job  
[0:47:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2843) I've only ever seen these things provide  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2846) enormous enormous value so I'm pretty  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2849) much out of time I think or running out  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2852) of time so there's a few other patents  
[0:47:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2857) we  
[0:47:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2860) that we won't get to today I have been  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2862) threatening for the last five years to  
[0:47:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2863) to write all these up in a book there's  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2865) a lean pub book called software faster  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2867) which has 43 of these in it the current  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2871) status is that there are forty three  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2874) chapters arranged into about ten  
[0:47:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2876) sections one of which is team which  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2878) we've been looking at today for each of  
[0:48:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2881) the chapters they have a pattern name  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2882) because that's the thing I've really  
[0:48:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2883) been iterating on and there's a kind of  
[0:48:05](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2885) a paragraph in which you know sort of  
[0:48:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2887) gives you an overview of the pattern and  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2888) then a few bullets of like messages from  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2891) this chapter and then what I'm doing is  
[0:48:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2892) going through and filling them out very  
[0:48:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2895) very slowly so we're up to current  
[0:48:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2897) status is 7% I've got about four of them  
[0:48:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2899) when it's out there anyway so have fun  
[0:48:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2903) with that I think that's all I wanted to  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2905) say so think about these things think  
[0:48:29](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2909) about your stand-ups think about how  
[0:48:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2911) teams are organized in terms of how they  
[0:48:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2913) do work how they pull work how they  
[0:48:34](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2914) consume work think about how well how  
[0:48:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2916) best you can get people working on the  
[0:48:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2920) kinds of things that they get excited  
[0:48:41](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2921) about because people working on things  
[0:48:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2923) that they get excited about is the best  
[0:48:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2925) way to get the best out of those people  
[0:48:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2926) and the best out of the things they  
[0:48:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2928) deliver think about every single and  
[0:48:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2932) what's really weird as well is this word  
[0:48:54](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2934) ceremony like are we doing all these  
[0:48:55](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2935) ceremonies ceremony is a pejorative term  
[0:48:58](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2938) ceremony is an insult right when you  
[0:49:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2941) talk about something being ceremonial it  
[0:49:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2943) means it has literally no purpose there  
[0:49:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2946) is no value to it other than it's a  
[0:49:08](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2948) thing you do and so teams proudly say  
[0:49:10](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2950) we're doing all the scrum ceremonies and  
[0:49:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2952) I'm like listen to the words you're  
[0:49:14](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2954) using are you getting value out of  
[0:49:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2957) planning or are you just losing a day  
[0:49:19](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2959) every two weeks and then coming out of  
[0:49:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2961) there and then five minutes later  
[0:49:22](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2962) something changes it anyway doesn't  
[0:49:24](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2964) matter right are you doing estimation  
[0:49:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2966) because someone wants heard story points  
[0:49:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2968) right do those things help with decision  
[0:49:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2970) making would you make decisions  
[0:49:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2971) differently any other way are they  
[0:49:33](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2973) effective ways of getting stuff done so  
[0:49:35](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2975) challenge every single thing that you  
[0:49:38](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2978) have as ceremonies and ask yourself  
[0:49:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2980) what's the real intent behind this could  
[0:49:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2983) we change this thing so we really do get  
[0:49:45](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2985) that value out of it that intent out of  
[0:49:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2986) it  
[0:49:47](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2987) and if not should we maybe just jettison  
[0:49:49](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2989) it you know retrospectives are a great  
[0:49:52](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2992) way for  
[0:49:53](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2993) to pause and reflect every now and then  
[0:49:56](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2996) high-performing teams do that in the  
[0:49:59](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=2999) moment okay so do you know what I've  
[0:50:01](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3001) just noticed something we should start  
[0:50:03](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3003) now I still suggest that you pause on a  
[0:50:06](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3006) regular basis there's like a human  
[0:50:07](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3007) cadence if you just go go go go people  
[0:50:09](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3009) get exhausted so pause anyway and  
[0:50:12](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3012) reflect and celebrate and all those  
[0:50:13](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3013) things but again every single one of  
[0:50:15](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3015) these things that even the things I'm  
[0:50:17](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3017) telling you right do not take these  
[0:50:18](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3018) things as law or as true these are  
[0:50:21](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3021) things that these are patterns which  
[0:50:23](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3023) means they may or may not be useful to  
[0:50:26](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3026) you okay they I have seen them be  
[0:50:28](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3028) effective in some contexts I've seen  
[0:50:30](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3030) them completely not working other  
[0:50:31](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3031) context so on that nonspecific note ask  
[0:50:36](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3036) yourself this  
[0:50:37](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3037) how can your team it be more effective  
[0:50:40](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3040) that's your homework question all right  
[0:50:43](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3043) what theme can you do on Monday what  
[0:50:46](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3046) thing can you do so your team can be  
[0:50:48](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3048) more effective thank  
[0:50:57](https://youtu.be/lvs7VEsQzKY?t=3057) you
