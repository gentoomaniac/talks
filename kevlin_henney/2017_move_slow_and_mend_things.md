## Description

Velocity. Sprints. Move fast and break things. There is a seeming obsession with speed of software development that is often at the expense of the software and its development. Velocity is a question of direction, not just magnitude. Sprints are not about sprinting; they're about sustainable pace. Time to market is less important than time in market. Full-stack development is normally a statement about technology, but it also applies to individuals and interactions. The full stack touches both the code and the world outside the code, and with that view comes responsibility and pause for thought.

Doing the wrong thing smarter is not smart. The point of a team is its group intelligence not its numbers. Is scaling up the challenge, or is scaling down the real challenge? Is architecture a fixed technical plan or an unfolding hypothesis? Is code quality just something for the developers, or is it also something for the customer? Are tests extra to or a part of development? Let's slow down and learn things.

Kevlin Henney is an independent consultant, speaker, writer and trainer. His software development interests are in patterns, programming, practice and process. He has been a columnist for various magazines and websites and has contributed to both open- and closed-source software. He is co-author of A Pattern Language for Distributed Computing and On Patterns and Pattern Languages, two volumes in the Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture series, and editor of 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know.

[0:00:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=4) good morning is that on can you hear  
[0:00:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=6) that yes excellent right so we've talked  
[0:00:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=10) about speed interestingly enough this is  
[0:00:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=13) a wonderful coincidence because mark  
[0:00:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=15) Reinhold was talking about speed of  
[0:00:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=16) delivery and then we've also been  
[0:00:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=18) talking about insane velocities at the  
[0:00:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=23) subatomic level I will include some  
[0:00:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=27) physics in this talk but I'm afraid it's  
[0:00:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=28) going to be a little bit more  
[0:00:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=29) fundamental a bit more Newtonian and  
[0:00:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=32) funny enough one of the things we were  
[0:00:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=33) talking about last year  
[0:00:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=34) Stephan and I was well let's put it this  
[0:00:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=37) way take you I want to take you back a  
[0:00:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=39) year to the time the nightmares began  
[0:00:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=43) actually nightmares began around June by  
[0:00:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=46) my reckoning and but the the nightmares  
[0:00:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=51) culminated in an event in the US which  
[0:00:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=55) happened to be the first day first  
[0:00:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=57) conference day of devoxx  
[0:01:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=60) because that came as a bit of a  
[0:01:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=62) bombshell we're still waiting for the  
[0:01:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=63) bombs to actually go off but that's a  
[0:01:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=65) matter of time more than anything else  
[0:01:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=66) and I told me Stefan about a talk and  
[0:01:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=70) some talks though I was doing where I  
[0:01:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=72) was trying to look very much  
[0:01:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=73) at the connection between developers  
[0:01:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=76) what they do how they do it and the  
[0:01:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=79) consequences that they have so that's  
[0:01:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=81) kind of what this talk is about it's  
[0:01:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=83) it's a number of different things  
[0:01:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=84) brought together but if you were to ask  
[0:01:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=86) me what is this talk about it's about 40  
[0:01:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=88) 45 minutes long that's the best I can do  
[0:01:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=92) so move slower men things what do we  
[0:01:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=95) mean by that well this is clearly in  
[0:01:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=98) opposition to new fast and break things  
[0:01:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=100) which is an old engineering saying  
[0:01:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=103) popularized very much very recently by  
[0:01:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=105) Facebook and I want to offer a  
[0:01:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=108) counterpoint here because we have an  
[0:01:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=111) obsession with just getting things out  
[0:01:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=115) there just a few weeks ago just in  
[0:01:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=117) anticipation of this talk somebody I was  
[0:02:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=121) talking to a developer we were looking  
[0:02:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=123) at something and he said I can't get  
[0:02:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=125) this code working this is a precis this  
[0:02:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=127) is the pre 280 character era so I have  
[0:02:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=131) reduced it accordingly but you can  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=133) imagine  
[0:02:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=133) the real conversation when when expanded  
[0:02:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=135) up to 280 I can't get this co-working  
[0:02:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=138) did you check it before integrating it  
[0:02:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=139) yes checked it in the interpreter we  
[0:02:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=141) were talking we were messing about with  
[0:02:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=142) some Python did it work there no now  
[0:02:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=147) this story is not unique  
[0:02:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=149) all around the world of software there  
[0:02:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=153) are people going well I didn't quite  
[0:02:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=154) work there but there's this kind of  
[0:02:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=156) deep-seated optimism and to be a  
[0:02:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=158) developer you have to have somewhere  
[0:02:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=160) within you an optimist because otherwise  
[0:02:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=162) you wouldn't do it okay you may have  
[0:02:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=165) pushed it down really deeply but it's  
[0:02:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=166) still there there's a deep-seated  
[0:02:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=168) optimism that hey just because it didn't  
[0:02:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=170) work in the test environment in the  
[0:02:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=171) repple or whatever you know what if I  
[0:02:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=173) just put it in the production system  
[0:02:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=174) magic will occur and it will just you  
[0:02:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=177) know I will cross my fingers and things  
[0:02:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=179) will collide and it'll all work out yeah  
[0:03:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=181) and this guy the funny thing is this  
[0:03:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=183) this was a recurring story with this guy  
[0:03:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=185) it was just like well I didn't work  
[0:03:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=187) there so I put it over here in the  
[0:03:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=188) bigger system it's just like no you  
[0:03:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=190) isolate things this is the this is the  
[0:03:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=192) law the principle of modularity we make  
[0:03:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=194) things smaller in order to understand  
[0:03:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=196) them it's basic reductionism here but  
[0:03:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=199) reduction isn't not everything so I will  
[0:03:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=200) get to that so we do have this obsession  
[0:03:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=202) with speed and it's not helpful in fact  
[0:03:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=206) the problem actually that we've ended up  
[0:03:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=208) with is that a lot of the time people  
[0:03:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=209) refrain they say oh no yeah we do out  
[0:03:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=212) velocity we even see it in a lot of  
[0:03:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=214) agile development when people are  
[0:03:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=216) talking about the progress through a  
[0:03:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=220) sprint through their features they use  
[0:03:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=224) the term velocity it really bugs me it  
[0:03:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=228) really bugs me somewhere in my past I  
[0:03:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=230) have a physics degree and this kind of  
[0:03:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=232) basic stuff really bugs me they have the  
[0:03:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=234) lowest velocity and speed are not the  
[0:03:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=236) same okay it turns out that if people  
[0:03:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=238) did care about their velocity then that  
[0:04:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=240) would be a really good thing okay  
[0:04:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=243) just keeping things flat we have the  
[0:04:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=246) idea that velocity has direction and it  
[0:04:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=249) turns out that going at high speed in  
[0:04:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=252) the wrong direction is not helpful okay  
[0:04:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=255) this is what most projects optimized for  
[0:04:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=259) they optimized for speed they should be  
[0:04:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=262) focused on velocity it turns out that if  
[0:04:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=265) we understood the direction  
[0:04:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=267) we were going we would do better things  
[0:04:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=269) hey guess what our technical debt is  
[0:04:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=271) rising yeah but we're getting the we're  
[0:04:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=273) getting these releases our customers are  
[0:04:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=275) unhappy customers yeah we are getting  
[0:04:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=278) more bugs or we're getting more code or  
[0:04:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=280) we're getting more we need to focus on  
[0:04:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=283) all of these things it's an N  
[0:04:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=285) dimensional space that we're actually  
[0:04:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=286) navigating through to is a very simple  
[0:04:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=289) number we can deal with that but there  
[0:04:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=290) is this idea that you're not just for if  
[0:04:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=293) you are just focused on delivering  
[0:04:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=294) functionality you're a crap developer  
[0:04:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=296) and your company is going to burn out  
[0:04:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=298) fairly quickly  
[0:04:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=299) everybody says that speed matters first  
[0:05:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=301) to market matters we know this is a  
[0:05:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=304) false statement  
[0:05:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=305) anybody here still using Alta Vista  
[0:05:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=308) right okay all right and I want you to  
[0:05:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=311) think about mobile phones again the  
[0:05:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=313) operating systems and the phone  
[0:05:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=315) manufacturers that we're using now first  
[0:05:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=317) to market is irrelevant unless you  
[0:05:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=320) actually care about being there for a  
[0:05:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=322) while it's how long are you in the  
[0:05:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=324) market okay that is what matters  
[0:05:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=326) let your opponents make those mistakes  
[0:05:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=328) first okay  
[0:05:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=330) that's what competition is partly about  
[0:05:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=331) so if you want to talk about speed let's  
[0:05:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=335) talk about speed what is it it's  
[0:05:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=339) displacement with respect to time okay  
[0:05:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=342) it's kind of a distance so so what is s  
[0:05:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=344) well let's let's let's do this let's do  
[0:05:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=346) this measure here's a burn down chart  
[0:05:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=348) here's all this OS is I'm going to use a  
[0:05:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=351) really technical term here so bear with  
[0:05:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=353) me s is short for stuff okay that's a  
[0:05:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=358) little too technical we can replace it  
[0:06:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=360) with story points or you know anything  
[0:06:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=363) else that takes you a fancy but there is  
[0:06:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=366) this idea here's all the stuff we're  
[0:06:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=369) going to do and then we burn down over  
[0:06:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=371) time or I prefer to be a little more  
[0:06:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=375) constructive I like the idea of a build  
[0:06:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=378) up I tend to call these build up charts  
[0:06:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=380) some people pull these burn up charts  
[0:06:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=383) I'm speaking as somebody who has a deep  
[0:06:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=388) interest in spaceflight and who's also  
[0:06:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=390) had children who've had fevers burning  
[0:06:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=393) up is a really bad thing so I prefer  
[0:06:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=396) build up it's constructive quite  
[0:06:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=398) literally we're going to talk about  
[0:06:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=399) incremental development here is Inc  
[0:06:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=401) gentle yeah after a period of time you  
[0:06:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=404) have more stuff than you did before that  
[0:06:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=406) is the basis of incremental development  
[0:06:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=407) so s is for stuff now the problem here  
[0:06:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=410) is how do we measure s this is where our  
[0:06:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=414) obsessions get a little bit distracted  
[0:06:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=416) okay so a little bit of dimensional  
[0:06:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=419) analysis time is a time thing well that  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=423) was easy  
[0:07:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=423) maybe you measured in days maybe you  
[0:07:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=426) measured in hours maybe you measured in  
[0:07:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=427) weeks maybe you sit there and you know  
[0:07:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=430) because your development process is so  
[0:07:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=432) magical mystical maybe you measure it in  
[0:07:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=434) phases of the moon you know because  
[0:07:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=437) that's what you see when you come out at  
[0:07:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=439) night can I've just finished the debug  
[0:07:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=443) session yeah now the question is what we  
[0:07:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=445) measure stuff in terms of and this is  
[0:07:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=448) really this is a difficult thing and  
[0:07:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=449) unfortunately or where we take  
[0:07:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=451) measurements really important we end up  
[0:07:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=452) measuring the wrong things and often  
[0:07:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=455) people sort of say well I want you to  
[0:07:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=456) we're gonna burn through stuff we're  
[0:07:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=458) gonna use proxy measures like story  
[0:07:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=462) points or even if we use real points we  
[0:07:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=465) end up with a measure of time it turns  
[0:07:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=468) out that in many cases these measures  
[0:07:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=470) that people say when they estimate how  
[0:07:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=472) much effort is this are actually proxy  
[0:07:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=475) measures of time this turns out to be a  
[0:07:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=478) measure of time against time I wish more  
[0:08:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=481) people had numerate degrees when they  
[0:08:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=483) went into project management this is a  
[0:08:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=485) measure of utilization it's not a  
[0:08:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=487) measure of how fast you're going it's a  
[0:08:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=490) measure of utilization or at best the  
[0:08:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=492) quality of your estimation that's it  
[0:08:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=495) you're not actually measuring what  
[0:08:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=496) people are doing you're certainly  
[0:08:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=498) measuring something and that only keeps  
[0:08:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=500) people very happy because there's  
[0:08:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=501) numbers and people like numbers we're  
[0:08:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=503) not in the petabyte level here well if  
[0:08:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=505) people can show numbers with decimal  
[0:08:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=506) points that's always impressive if  
[0:08:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=509) people say oh it's about a week that  
[0:08:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=510) doesn't sound impressive if you say  
[0:08:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=512) that's going to be our we reckon that's  
[0:08:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=513) a four to three hour and 22 minute job  
[0:08:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=515) it's just like wow that's precision we  
[0:08:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=518) really care about accuracy precision is  
[0:08:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=520) irrelevant okay when it comes to  
[0:08:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=522) building things that we have not yet  
[0:08:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=523) built before so how do we deal with the  
[0:08:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=525) unknown how do we deal with actually  
[0:08:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=528) making progress okay it turns out that  
[0:08:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=531) there's kind of a there's a there's a  
[0:08:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=533) number of loops that people like  
[0:08:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=535) this is John Boyd's doodle-loop  
[0:08:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=538) John Boyd US Air Force pilot he  
[0:09:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=543) basically basically this is this kind of  
[0:09:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=546) orthodoxy of how to teach fighter pilots  
[0:09:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=548) and what are you gonna do you observe  
[0:09:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=551) what's happening you orient yourself you  
[0:09:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=554) understand where you're at and where you  
[0:09:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=556) want to be where you're at and where you  
[0:09:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=558) want to be that is the basis of the  
[0:09:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=560) concept of velocity I am here I want to  
[0:09:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=563) be there this is direction okay it's not  
[0:09:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=566) about the speed aspects about the  
[0:09:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=568) direction aspect then you develop a plan  
[0:09:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=571) for action and then in the greatest of  
[0:09:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=573) Star Trek traditions you make it so okay  
[0:09:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=576) so the point here is you've got a  
[0:09:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=579) deliberate approach to this instead of  
[0:09:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=582) running after things we're going to  
[0:09:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=584) cycle through things the idea is that  
[0:09:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=586) the cycle is a revisiting and that is a  
[0:09:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=589) fundamental concept that a linear  
[0:09:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=592) thinking model does not give us now I'm  
[0:09:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=594) going to flip this to 180 degrees  
[0:09:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=596) because that's just fun actually there's  
[0:09:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=599) a reason I'm doing that it turns out  
[0:10:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=600) that people are always pushing these  
[0:10:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=601) models out and they're always loopy  
[0:10:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=604) here's another one it aligns perfectly  
[0:10:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=607) the names are different they've been  
[0:10:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=609) changed to protect the innocent PDSA  
[0:10:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=611) sometimes PDCA plan-do-check-act the  
[0:10:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=614) Deming shuart cycle plan establish a  
[0:10:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=616) hypothesis a goal or or what it is that  
[0:10:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=620) you wish to do this idea of hypothesis  
[0:10:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=622) is really interesting in software  
[0:10:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=624) development you are not building what  
[0:10:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=625) you already know okay we solved that  
[0:10:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=628) problem a long time ago yeah if you  
[0:10:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=631) already know how to do it then it's  
[0:10:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=632) probably in a library okay if you  
[0:10:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=635) already know how to do it it's probably  
[0:10:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=637) in your intellisense the thing is you  
[0:10:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=639) are building something that you haven't  
[0:10:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=641) built before oh it might be similar to  
[0:10:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=643) but it's not identical the identical  
[0:10:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=645) problems been solved so I've got an idea  
[0:10:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=648) about how I'm going to do something I've  
[0:10:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=649) got an idea about the architecture I've  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=651) got an idea  
[0:10:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=651) about the performance and I think that  
[0:10:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=655) this might be the way to do it I've got  
[0:10:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=656) an idea about the domain model based on  
[0:10:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=658) my understanding of the business and I  
[0:10:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=659) think this might be the way to do it I  
[0:11:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=661) don't yet know but it's a hypothesis  
[0:11:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=663) what do we do with hypotheses we test  
[0:11:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=665) them okay so we're going to do something  
[0:11:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=667) about it we're going to  
[0:11:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=668) that into action then we're going to  
[0:11:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=670) study it and then they were going to  
[0:11:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=672) revise act here is different from the  
[0:11:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=674) unicycle unicycle and we're gonna act  
[0:11:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=677) we're going to do something now what's  
[0:11:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=679) interesting here is this is the  
[0:11:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=680) foundation of empirical thinking what  
[0:11:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=683) you're doing here is you're saying  
[0:11:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=684) here's the thing I've got an idea  
[0:11:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=686) here's a hypothesis what are we gonna do  
[0:11:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=689) about it well let's just try it okay  
[0:11:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=690) what are we now gonna do this this is  
[0:11:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=692) the hard bit by the way you see there's  
[0:11:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=694) a line there's the top half and the  
[0:11:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=697) bottom half I often refer to these  
[0:11:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=699) things as the water line the water line  
[0:11:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=701) if you look at a ship in this in the  
[0:11:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=704) water the bit you can't see is below the  
[0:11:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=706) water line an iceberg it has a water  
[0:11:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=709) line there's an awful lot more below it  
[0:11:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=711) the problem is that much of our business  
[0:11:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=715) much of our day-to-day work is focused  
[0:11:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=717) on everything that is above the water  
[0:11:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=718) line if somebody says oh you know  
[0:12:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=721) planning yeah I can show you that I can  
[0:12:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=724) show you planning in post-its I can show  
[0:12:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=726) you planning in Gantt charts I've got  
[0:12:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=729) lots of ways of showing planning doing  
[0:12:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=730) I've got a whole office full of people  
[0:12:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=733) doing yeah you can see doing this you  
[0:12:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=737) can see doing this in check-ins you can  
[0:12:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=739) see doing this in past tests you can't  
[0:12:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=741) kind of see doing this in the way that  
[0:12:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=743) they show in films my kids were  
[0:12:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=745) desperately disappointed to discover  
[0:12:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=746) that software development is not the way  
[0:12:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=748) it is portrayed in movies okay in movies  
[0:12:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=751) you got some pounding industrial rock  
[0:12:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=753) you've got multiple screens and somebody  
[0:12:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=755) is just hacking on something the last  
[0:12:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=757) minute the code is projected on their  
[0:12:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=758) face that's the reason I do  
[0:12:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=761) presentations it's the only way you can  
[0:12:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=762) get Co projected on your face and it's  
[0:12:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=766) all very exciting a roomful of  
[0:12:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=768) successful software developers from the  
[0:12:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=770) outside speaking as an observational  
[0:12:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=773) point of view is no different to a  
[0:12:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=774) roomful of people looking at pictures of  
[0:12:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=776) cats on the internet it is most  
[0:12:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=778) disappointing so we have to look around  
[0:13:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=781) for different ways different proxies of  
[0:13:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=782) doing this so plan and do you're highly  
[0:13:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=784) visible but study what was that so what  
[0:13:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=786) does that look like we're thinking we're  
[0:13:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=789) thinking real hard and then we're gonna  
[0:13:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=791) think about what we're gonna do next  
[0:13:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=792) exact it turns out this is the bit that  
[0:13:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=795) moves you from mere incrementalism and  
[0:13:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=798) speed obsession to understanding  
[0:13:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=800) adjustment so  
[0:13:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=803) it's a new idea it's not a new idea  
[0:13:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=806) it's an idea as old as software  
[0:13:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=808) engineering now software engineering  
[0:13:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=810) sometimes people this is a classic  
[0:13:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=813) conference the NATO conference 1968  
[0:13:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=815) Garmisch and some people say that the  
[0:13:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=819) conference invented this term this is  
[0:13:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=821) not exactly an accurate but there are a  
[0:13:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=823) couple of things I want to observe here  
[0:13:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=824) first of all just look at the typeface  
[0:13:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=827) it's beautiful its glorious this is  
[0:13:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=829) 1960s this is Gil songs which by an  
[0:13:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=831) amazing coincidence is the same font  
[0:13:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=835) that is used for 2001 a Space Odyssey  
[0:13:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=837) release the same year ok coincidence I  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=841) think not  
[0:14:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=841) ok mysterious things happen in that film  
[0:14:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=844) it's wonderful now the point here is  
[0:14:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=846) Margaret Hamilton best known for writing  
[0:14:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=850) the software for Apollo 11 or being one  
[0:14:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=852) of the key people there and basically  
[0:14:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=854) giving us a concept of what soft  
[0:14:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=855) software fault tolerance is about she  
[0:14:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=858) coined the term originally and a lot of  
[0:14:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=861) people say oh well this is set up kind  
[0:14:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=863) of like things like the waterfall  
[0:14:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=865) lifecycle and anything grained this kind  
[0:14:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=867) of plan driven thinking rather than plan  
[0:14:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=870) do study act plan do study act we do all  
[0:14:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=873) our planning in one go where there's no  
[0:14:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=874) deliberation this is not true now I'm  
[0:14:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=877) not going to say that the 1960s were  
[0:14:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=879) definitely the epitome of human  
[0:14:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=882) civilization although there are days I  
[0:14:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=885) look at the newspaper and think you know  
[0:14:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=886) it wasn't so bad but if we look at  
[0:14:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=889) various things spun from a check-in slow  
[0:14:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=891) oh it's absolutely lovely the design  
[0:14:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=895) process is an iterative 109 68 I will  
[0:15:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=901) tell you one thing which can go wrong  
[0:15:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=902) with you you're not in the laboratory  
[0:15:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=903) and my terms design consists of flow  
[0:15:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=905) chart and tilt well obviously there was  
[0:15:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=907) no other design notation around but the  
[0:15:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=910) basic idea of you can replace that with  
[0:15:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=912) anything you like but the idea of doodle  
[0:15:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=914) draw think talk to somebody whatever it  
[0:15:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=917) is but clarify your thinking flowchart  
[0:15:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=920) until you realize until you think you  
[0:15:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=922) understand the problem write code until  
[0:15:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=923) that you realize that you don't that is  
[0:15:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=926) perfect there the rest of this document  
[0:15:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=928) is so dry and yet I don't know who this  
[0:15:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=931) guy was I've done some googling about  
[0:15:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=933) Kinslow can't even find a first name a  
[0:15:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=934) check Kinsler  
[0:15:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=936) but it's some pretty interesting stuff  
[0:15:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=938) but there's some dry humor in there I  
[0:15:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=940) love it go back and redo the flowchart  
[0:15:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=943) write some more code and iterate to what  
[0:15:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=945) you feel is the correct solution we knew  
[0:15:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=947) the answer in the 1960s I'm not saying  
[0:15:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=950) this is perfect but something happened I  
[0:15:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=952) don't know was it disco was it I don't  
[0:15:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=954) know 1970s yeah whose Flair's of disco  
[0:15:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=957) one of the two but you know we see  
[0:15:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=959) within this document there are gems of  
[0:16:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=961) wisdom but there is a fundamental thing  
[0:16:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=964) here my favorite one of my favorite  
[0:16:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=965) authors Neil Gaiman you have to finish  
[0:16:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=967) things that's what you learn from you  
[0:16:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=969) learn by finishing things the whole  
[0:16:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=971) point is to give yourself the  
[0:16:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=972) opportunity to do something do it again  
[0:16:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=975) do it again learn move further now what  
[0:16:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=978) does that mean for software development  
[0:16:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=979) as a whole what it means is that there  
[0:16:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=982) is no concept of design and refactoring  
[0:16:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=984) refactoring is a part of design there is  
[0:16:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=988) the bit that you say forward there is  
[0:16:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=990) the bit where you say here is what I  
[0:16:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=992) think here's what I'm doing and here's  
[0:16:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=995) what I now understand and have learnt  
[0:16:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=997) and this is what I change if full design  
[0:16:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1000) cycle must include this concept  
[0:16:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1004) otherwise you build up all kinds of  
[0:16:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1005) problems you build up technical debt and  
[0:16:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1007) so on but I'm resting here we're going  
[0:16:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1010) to talk about improving the design of  
[0:16:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1011) existing code what do we mean by code  
[0:16:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1014) now for a lot of people they have a very  
[0:16:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1016) specific idea of what they mean by code  
[0:16:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1017) for a lot of developers they have a very  
[0:17:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1020) you say cones yeah a programming  
[0:17:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1023) language or an IDE pops into their mind  
[0:17:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1025) without their even thinking about it and  
[0:17:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1027) when it sometimes people when you ask  
[0:17:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1029) them about the code assets of their  
[0:17:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1031) project they will tell you but they're  
[0:17:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1034) normally thinking primarily of like oh  
[0:17:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1036) it's the Java code it's the Scala code  
[0:17:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1038) it's the and they're thinking of that  
[0:17:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1040) no no I'm talking about the test as well  
[0:17:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1043) I'm talking about scripts I'm talking  
[0:17:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1045) about the XML and talk about all of it  
[0:17:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1046) it's all code okay it all has a formal  
[0:17:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1050) grammar it all has a meaning and without  
[0:17:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1053) any part of it something in your system  
[0:17:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1055) will not run or there is a piece of  
[0:17:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1057) knowledge you are missing so when I say  
[0:17:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1059) code I mean in the broadest  
[0:17:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1060) comprehensive term way possible but  
[0:17:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1063) there's another way we can look at it  
[0:17:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1065) it's codified knowledge that is what a  
[0:17:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1068) code basis there are we often have many  
[0:17:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1070) parallels for thinking about what it is  
[0:17:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1072) that our code is but I wanted to think I  
[0:17:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1076) want you to think about is codified  
[0:17:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1077) knowledge it is a basic collective  
[0:18:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1080) understanding this is what we currently  
[0:18:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1082) believe and this is how we are building  
[0:18:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1084) it this is how we've organized this is  
[0:18:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1085) our understanding of the domain this is  
[0:18:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1088) our understanding of the technologies  
[0:18:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1089) and this is our understanding of how  
[0:18:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1091) we're going to do this now some of you  
[0:18:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1093) might be sitting there going well oh  
[0:18:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1094) that's a bit uncomfortable because our  
[0:18:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1097) system is a mess what does that say  
[0:18:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1098) about our knowledge what it says this is  
[0:18:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1101) another way of looking at technical debt  
[0:18:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1103) is that unfortunately we have a problem  
[0:18:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1106) with updating our knowledge what we find  
[0:18:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1108) is that when we come to a system we end  
[0:18:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1110) up with this is what we thought last  
[0:18:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1112) week this is and what we thought last  
[0:18:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1114) year simultaneously with what somebody  
[0:18:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1116) thought five years ago and all of these  
[0:18:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1118) are current and present that is our  
[0:18:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1120) problem we would like there to be this  
[0:18:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1122) is our current understanding and have  
[0:18:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1124) everything be as close to our current  
[0:18:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1126) understanding as possible rather than  
[0:18:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1127) having this kind of like sort of  
[0:18:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1129) knowledge splurge okay you can kind of  
[0:18:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1132) look at the code and from a knowledge  
[0:18:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1133) point of view you can say yeah this is  
[0:18:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1135) postmodernist this is pre-renaissance  
[0:18:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1136) you know it looks like that in some  
[0:18:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1138) systems yeah so there is that feeling  
[0:19:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1140) but codified knowledge this is a  
[0:19:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1142) knowledge base manage it as a knowledge  
[0:19:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1145) base so what does that mean for the very  
[0:19:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1148) process and practices of software  
[0:19:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1150) development if what we're talking about  
[0:19:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1153) is the gathering of knowledge and I  
[0:19:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1155) don't mean just going on kind of new new  
[0:19:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1157) courses and new talks and learning about  
[0:19:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1160) new api's I'm talking about  
[0:19:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1162) understanding how to work with people  
[0:19:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1163) understanding how to work with the  
[0:19:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1166) domain understand learning all of this  
[0:19:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1168) stuff it's it's it's all knowledge  
[0:19:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1170) acquisition that is the primary axis  
[0:19:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1173) it's not a production model software  
[0:19:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1175) development is not a production thing it  
[0:19:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1177) is a knowledge acquisition thing the  
[0:19:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1178) production problem was solved a very  
[0:19:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1180) very long time ago the basis of  
[0:19:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1182) production is here is what I want to  
[0:19:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1184) build and then it's built it turns out  
[0:19:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1188) and Derek in the previous talk put up  
[0:19:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1190) Fortran Fortran is a really important  
[0:19:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1193) language in history I wish you would  
[0:19:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1196) stay there  
[0:19:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1197) okay I was a Fortran programmer once it  
[0:19:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1199) is it is if if you want to get paid by  
[0:20:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1204) the keyword by the line do Fortran I  
[0:20:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1208) recently had to revisit Fortran for a  
[0:20:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1210) client and I was astonished at how much  
[0:20:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1215) code was was involved I mean earlier  
[0:20:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1218) mark mentioned you know velocity in Java  
[0:20:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1221) it's just like if you like verbosity  
[0:20:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1223) ditched java immediately you are in the  
[0:20:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1225) wrong place my friends yeah go for  
[0:20:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1227) Fortran however historically very very  
[0:20:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1231) important late 1950s it gave us a sense  
[0:20:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1233) of here is a thing I would like to have  
[0:20:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1236) built and a way to build it it's called  
[0:20:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1238) a compiler okay it's a solved problem  
[0:20:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1240) software development is not a production  
[0:20:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1243) model it is a knowledge acquisition  
[0:20:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1245) process that is what you do now I would  
[0:20:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1248) just like to point out that knowledge  
[0:20:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1249) acquisition is a term that you use to  
[0:20:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1251) your superiors and when you're trying to  
[0:20:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1253) make a case for something so tell us  
[0:20:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1255) about your self a development process  
[0:20:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1256) well it's based on a knowledge  
[0:20:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1257) acquisition model mmm sounds impressive  
[0:20:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1259) the rest of us just call it learning ok  
[0:21:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1262) knowledge acquisitions got more  
[0:21:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1263) syllables more words more references to  
[0:21:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1266) Latin yeah learning nice and simple so  
[0:21:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1269) what does that mean what that means in  
[0:21:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1271) practice that how do we get knowledge  
[0:21:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1273) from one place to another through  
[0:21:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1276) communication and it turns out  
[0:21:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1277) everything is communication face to face  
[0:21:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1280) conversation the code those check-in  
[0:21:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1285) messages there's conversations by the  
[0:21:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1287) coffee machine everything this is all  
[0:21:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1288) communication and what we're after is  
[0:21:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1290) two it doesn't matter if one person  
[0:21:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1293) knows something  
[0:21:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1294) brilliantly and nobody else does we need  
[0:21:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1297) to spread the knowledge around there is  
[0:21:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1299) this idea if you like that it is not  
[0:21:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1302) that we lack the knowledge I think in  
[0:21:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1304) software development to be quite frank  
[0:21:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1305) based on some of the things I've looked  
[0:21:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1308) at recently I think we have solved  
[0:21:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1310) pretty much all of the problems that  
[0:21:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1312) software development has ever thought of  
[0:21:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1314) as a problem all of the problems that  
[0:21:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1317) companies are experiencing or a very  
[0:21:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1318) large lemme let me not say all over a  
[0:22:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1320) precise definition of all 100% so let's  
[0:22:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1323) talk about 95 plus percent of the  
[0:22:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1325) problems that organizations experience  
[0:22:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1328) with software and its development  
[0:22:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1331) are solved problems the problem is not  
[0:22:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1333) that we haven't solved them it's just  
[0:22:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1334) that we haven't got the knowledge  
[0:22:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1335) distributed around it's a little bit  
[0:22:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1337) like William Gibson's quote the future  
[0:22:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1339) is already here it's just not evenly  
[0:22:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1342) distributed we actually know how to do  
[0:22:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1344) all this stuff it's just not in  
[0:22:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1345) everybody's heads at the same time so we  
[0:22:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1347) need to get that knowledge around what  
[0:22:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1350) does that mean for our view of software  
[0:22:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1352) architecture and what a code base is  
[0:22:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1353) software architecture is a social  
[0:22:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1355) negotiation we tend to think of it as a  
[0:22:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1357) technical product and we tend to focus  
[0:22:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1360) on certain qualities but actually it's a  
[0:22:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1361) it's a it's a it's how we talk to each  
[0:22:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1363) other what you're doing when you own as  
[0:22:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1365) a software architecture is arranging  
[0:22:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1366) who's gonna talk to who at what time  
[0:22:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1368) what are the things that are going to  
[0:22:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1369) change what are the things you don't  
[0:22:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1370) need to worry about one of things you do  
[0:22:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1372) need to worry about which means it's a  
[0:22:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1374) model of participation now that's quite  
[0:22:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1376) important because software development  
[0:22:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1378) it's one of those things that we  
[0:23:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1380) definitely notes lots of people get  
[0:23:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1382) involved it so there is this verb Jax  
[0:23:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1387) magazine recently I was interviewed and  
[0:23:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1390) I made this point the biggest advantage  
[0:23:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1392) of autonomously working teams is risk  
[0:23:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1394) reduction through increased group  
[0:23:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1395) intelligence group intelligence that's  
[0:23:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1398) what we're trying to do you know I mean  
[0:23:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1400) it the idea of harnessing up a bunch of  
[0:23:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1402) developers and you know sort of  
[0:23:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1404) attaching them to a machine is very  
[0:23:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1406) cyberpunk you know it's very cool it's  
[0:23:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1408) not quite what I'm after but you are  
[0:23:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1410) after harnessing Team intelligence but  
[0:23:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1413) it turns out that just getting a bunch  
[0:23:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1415) of smart people together is not enough  
[0:23:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1417) okay there's a little correlation  
[0:23:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1419) between a groups collective intelligence  
[0:23:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1420) and the IQs of its individual members  
[0:23:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1422) okay collective intelligence is a is a  
[0:23:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1425) slightly slippery phenomenon you know it  
[0:23:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1428) doesn't always work out sometimes you  
[0:23:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1430) end up with groupthink and mass  
[0:23:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1432) stupidity yeah that may be on your team  
[0:23:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1435) in Britain we have referendums we've got  
[0:23:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1437) lots of different ways of demonstrating  
[0:23:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1438) that so do not assume you are immune to  
[0:24:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1443) it in other words there's something else  
[0:24:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1445) here not enough to have individually  
[0:24:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1448) intelligent people you need to have a  
[0:24:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1450) way of coordinating this model of  
[0:24:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1452) participation how are they getting on  
[0:24:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1454) with each other my code is brilliant but  
[0:24:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1456) your sucks does not help because it  
[0:24:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1458) means overall the code sucks there's a  
[0:24:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1460) sharp discontinuity in the code base and  
[0:24:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1463) it turns out that the other person may  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1464) have  
[0:24:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1464) exactly the same point of view which  
[0:24:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1466) doesn't really help so what we're  
[0:24:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1469) talking about here is how do we get  
[0:24:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1470) people working together this actually  
[0:24:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1472) comes from a particular piece of  
[0:24:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1475) research a few years ago if a group  
[0:24:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1477) includes more women it's collective  
[0:24:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1478) intelligence Rises you could be smarter  
[0:24:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1481) but I want you to think about this what  
[0:24:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1483) we're looking at here is a point that  
[0:24:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1487) James Surowiecki made in his book the  
[0:24:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1489) wisdom of crowds why the many are  
[0:24:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1493) smarter than a few strictly speaking  
[0:24:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1494) what I'm interested is not why but when  
[0:24:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1496) because there he outlines very very  
[0:24:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1499) specific precondition to an intelligent  
[0:25:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1501) group to a smart crowd the four  
[0:25:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1503) conditions that characterized wise  
[0:25:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1505) crowds diversity of opinion you need to  
[0:25:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1508) think differently if you're not thinking  
[0:25:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1511) differently then it turns out you're not  
[0:25:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1512) all thinking okay and the point there is  
[0:25:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1514) it's okay we're not talking about toxic  
[0:25:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1516) individuals you've always get one kind  
[0:25:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1518) of socially crazy individual that kind  
[0:25:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1520) of brings down the rest  
[0:25:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1521) no don't recruit them we're not talking  
[0:25:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1523) about them we are talking about the fact  
[0:25:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1525) that not everybody has to think the same  
[0:25:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1527) way they draw they they are not  
[0:25:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1530) necessarily influenced by other people  
[0:25:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1532) and they are able to draw from their own  
[0:25:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1534) experience and own knowledge if you  
[0:25:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1535) recruit people for company fit or people  
[0:25:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1539) like us then what you've just done is  
[0:25:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1542) you've actually killed off the some of  
[0:25:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1545) the greatest inputs to group  
[0:25:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1546) intelligence and a lot of these are very  
[0:25:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1549) standard HR but also standard ways in  
[0:25:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1552) which people will run startups they will  
[0:25:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1553) look for people like them an aggregation  
[0:25:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1557) turns out it's no good having all these  
[0:25:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1559) brilliant ideas you have to bring it  
[0:26:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1560) together the codebase is one place to  
[0:26:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1562) bring it together the kitchen is another  
[0:26:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1564) place you bring it together these are  
[0:26:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1566) all part of a larger system so when I  
[0:26:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1568) use the word system I use it very  
[0:26:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1570) differently to the meaning of software  
[0:26:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1571) system these are around the software  
[0:26:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1574) system the other thing though is when we  
[0:26:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1576) talk about this stuff when we talk about  
[0:26:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1577) speed we're obsessed we're very simple  
[0:26:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1580) we're human we're very simple we talk  
[0:26:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1582) about things like size it's apparently  
[0:26:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1584) size matters which I think's like scale  
[0:26:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1586) because it's very impressive from a  
[0:26:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1588) business point of view and when we talk  
[0:26:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1590) about craft it's this kind of question  
[0:26:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1592) of like you know yeah these are both  
[0:26:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1595) these are both watercraft  
[0:26:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1597) you know it's just like some  
[0:26:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1599) organizations favor the smaller model  
[0:26:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1601) some say oh no no we we're doing proper  
[0:26:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1604) development and you can sense the proper  
[0:26:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1607) development or real development comes  
[0:26:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1609) with its own font and emphasis when they  
[0:26:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1611) say that oh I see what you're doing your  
[0:26:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1613) recommendations are fine for a little  
[0:26:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1615) team producing toy fizzbuzz solutions  
[0:26:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1617) but we're producing enterprise software  
[0:26:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1619) we know this because we've got project  
[0:27:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1622) managers and we've got enterprise in the  
[0:27:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1624) title of other there are by the way if  
[0:27:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1625) you don't use the word enterprise there  
[0:27:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1627) are a few others that people like to use  
[0:27:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1629) they sometimes projects have the word  
[0:27:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1631) integration in them that's always a  
[0:27:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1633) clear signal global is another popular  
[0:27:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1636) one there's lots of different indicators  
[0:27:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1638) I still prefer enterprise for the Star  
[0:27:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1641) Trek overtones but there is this idea  
[0:27:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1644) that what we do is we get more people  
[0:27:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1647) and we get more code and we bring it all  
[0:27:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1649) together we make it bigger because this  
[0:27:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1652) is the basic concept of economics of  
[0:27:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1655) scale that would drove the Industrial  
[0:27:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1657) Revolution but it turns out we are doing  
[0:27:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1658) thought work we are not doing production  
[0:27:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1660) work it turns out that knowledge based  
[0:27:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1662) work is not a case of mass parallelism  
[0:27:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1665) just just just launch the cause and see  
[0:27:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1668) what happens soft way to Vallon does not  
[0:27:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1671) have economies of scale friend of mine  
[0:27:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1672) now and Kelly observe this in beyond  
[0:27:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1673) projects it has diseconomies of scale so  
[0:27:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1676) I I wanted to reconstruct an equation  
[0:27:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1679) and actually I went a bit further than  
[0:28:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1681) the equation I was shown something  
[0:28:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1682) relatively early in my career it was a  
[0:28:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1684) paper and I'd lost the photocopy which  
[0:28:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1687) shows you how old it is for those of you  
[0:28:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1689) who are too young to know what it is  
[0:28:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1691) photocopying is kind of like a  
[0:28:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1692) socialized form of scanning okay but I I  
[0:28:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1697) had a photocopy of this this paper and I  
[0:28:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1702) thought oh I'm gonna try and reconstruct  
[0:28:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1703) it and I discovered I actually went a  
[0:28:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1705) bit further so let's just state yeah  
[0:28:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1707) this is it's simple thought experiment  
[0:28:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1708) T's time t1 completion time for one  
[0:28:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1711) person how long is it gonna take one  
[0:28:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1713) person to do all of the software  
[0:28:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1714) development tasks that we need  
[0:28:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1716) everything that's involved so I'm not  
[0:28:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1718) just talking about coding I'm talking  
[0:28:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1720) about deployment I'm talking about the  
[0:28:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1722) business requirements I'm talking about  
[0:28:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1723) the whole thing all software development  
[0:28:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1725) related activities okay then  
[0:28:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1727) we step into modern economics in the  
[0:28:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1730) industrial revolution we're going to put  
[0:28:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1733) n people on a division of labour okay  
[0:28:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1736) two people were going to get twice as  
[0:28:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1738) fast three people go three times this is  
[0:28:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1739) fantastic this is brilliant  
[0:29:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1742) wait a moment there can you all do it at  
[0:29:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1744) the same time yeah turns out that  
[0:29:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1746) there's another equation we may care  
[0:29:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1748) about okay the portion you can do in  
[0:29:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1751) parallel can you do everything at the  
[0:29:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1754) same time now this what happens here  
[0:29:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1757) what what informs P what informs P is  
[0:29:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1760) the architecture the coding standards  
[0:29:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1764) the specialization of roles the  
[0:29:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1767) artifacts that are deemed necessary or  
[0:29:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1769) appropriate for the project it turns out  
[0:29:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1772) that this we create wait States now you  
[0:29:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1775) may find it you know then sent many  
[0:29:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1776) organizations you don't necessarily find  
[0:29:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1778) people sitting in wait States looking at  
[0:29:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1780) pictures of cats on the internet we use  
[0:29:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1783) other work to fill up the spaces yeah we  
[0:29:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1786) organize oh well we're always be busy so  
[0:29:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1788) well you know we'll make ourselves  
[0:29:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1790) busier with that project when we're  
[0:29:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1791) waiting for that project the portion in  
[0:29:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1794) parallel turns out to be absolutely  
[0:29:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1795) critical and this reflects the  
[0:29:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1797) organization around it in fact we were  
[0:29:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1799) Ennio this one mystical dam does law we  
[0:30:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1800) normally apply it to processes rather  
[0:30:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1802) than people okay however this is a good  
[0:30:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1805) opportunity for me to point out this is  
[0:30:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1806) an idealized model people are not  
[0:30:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1808) plug-and-play but there is you know this  
[0:30:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1811) is a simplified model um but we go  
[0:30:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1815) further what about the fact that people  
[0:30:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1817) need to communicate with one another and  
[0:30:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1818) talk to one another in the worst  
[0:30:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1821) possible case you created a work  
[0:30:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1824) environment and an architecture you  
[0:30:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1826) created a code base and a culture that  
[0:30:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1829) requires everybody to talk to everybody  
[0:30:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1830) else at the same time okay  
[0:30:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1832) that's the worst case scenario so this  
[0:30:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1834) is a reflection of your architecture and  
[0:30:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1836) all of these things and there is a  
[0:30:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1838) communication overhead so this is the  
[0:30:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1840) worst case scenario  
[0:30:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1841) it only gets slightly better which  
[0:30:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1843) mitigates that but there is this idea  
[0:30:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1845) that you get a little bit of control in  
[0:30:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1846) that now a lot of people kind of look at  
[0:30:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1848) that and go that's really kind of cute  
[0:30:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1849) there's lots of parentheses in there I  
[0:30:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1851) have no idea okay  
[0:30:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1852) people love graphs there you go boom so  
[0:30:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1855) what do we learn from this we learn that  
[0:30:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1856) if you put no developers on a project  
[0:30:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1858) you don't get any progress you also  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1861) don't get any bug  
[0:31:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1861) so it's not all bad okay it will take  
[0:31:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1864) infinite time now as you start adding  
[0:31:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1866) people things speed up but what's really  
[0:31:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1869) interesting is the form of this curve  
[0:31:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1871) the only way you can really change  
[0:31:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1872) things is by changing the collective  
[0:31:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1874) knowledge not the individual it's the  
[0:31:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1875) collective knowledge the flow between  
[0:31:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1878) people the architecture there's a few  
[0:31:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1882) things you can change you can change the  
[0:31:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1884) scope as well the problem is we're very  
[0:31:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1886) simple those all sound a bit subtle  
[0:31:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1888) we're very simple we like the dial  
[0:31:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1890) called n we like that dial and it  
[0:31:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1893) becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy  
[0:31:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1894) because what you end up with is over  
[0:31:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1897) here all the way over here this is where  
[0:31:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1900) the consultancies operate yes that'll  
[0:31:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1902) take 15 graduates to work on your  
[0:31:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1905) project and will charge you per the  
[0:31:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1907) person hour yeah it becomes a  
[0:31:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1910) self-fulfilling prophecy and then you  
[0:31:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1911) get organizations say well you know we  
[0:31:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1913) had a project about the same size two  
[0:31:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1914) years ago and there were 60 people on  
[0:31:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1916) that and that wasn't quite enough so  
[0:31:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1917) this time we're going to put 70 people  
[0:31:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1919) no try try 30 try 15 be bold and this is  
[0:32:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1925) a point that it turns out that above a  
[0:32:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1927) certain scale there is no indication and  
[0:32:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1930) we've seen so many different examples in  
[0:32:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1933) the world of software there's no  
[0:32:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1934) indication that functionality correlates  
[0:32:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1936) with number of people what it correlates  
[0:32:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1938) what number of people correlates with  
[0:32:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1939) the amount of work the amount of  
[0:32:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1941) busyness and you know he mounts her  
[0:32:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1944) self-importance and we end up with some  
[0:32:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1945) insane examples what my favorite ones  
[0:32:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1947) was this one guy took T SAS application  
[0:32:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1953) they had a head this way application got  
[0:32:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1957) yes I'm aware of that here yeah so a  
[0:32:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1960) head this way because obviously this is  
[0:32:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1962) what people need when they enter the  
[0:32:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1964) u.s. is you have two security gates  
[0:32:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1967) there and there and you have an arrow  
[0:32:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1969) and you randomly press it and it goes  
[0:32:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1973) left or right telling you which cue to  
[0:32:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1975) go in that'll really randomize the  
[0:32:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1977) terrorists they'll be completely  
[0:32:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1978) befuddled by this you know well you know  
[0:33:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1982) didn't see that one coming Perry that  
[0:33:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1986) cost fifty thousand dollars to create  
[0:33:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1988) and two hundred and fifty thousand  
[0:33:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1991) dollars to deploy I want to be the  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1995) company  
[0:33:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1995) was doing that okay it was an ILO as an  
[0:33:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=1998) iOS application somebody created this in  
[0:33:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2002) ten minutes in a YouTube video and you  
[0:33:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2005) know what he was using Android and you  
[0:33:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2007) know what he's been fairly relaxed he  
[0:33:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2009) was making some mistakes if he really  
[0:33:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2010) hurried he could have done it in five  
[0:33:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2011) minutes so ten minutes at a slow pace I  
[0:33:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2015) decided you know what I think I can do  
[0:33:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2017) better than that so the thing I just  
[0:33:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2018) showed you on my phone I decided you  
[0:33:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2020) know I don't think you even need that I  
[0:33:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2022) said I think you can do this in my least  
[0:33:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2025) favorite language JavaScript let's just  
[0:33:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2028) do this yeah we do that there you go  
[0:33:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2030) unload on click there we go  
[0:33:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2031) it's script yeah that I'm gonna be I'm  
[0:33:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2036) gonna be proper I'm gonna put body and I  
[0:33:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2038) can't be pods by HD ml in there you go  
[0:34:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2040) that's it that's all that's all you need  
[0:34:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2042) I would like to you know I showed this  
[0:34:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2043) to my kids and my teenager just looked  
[0:34:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2046) at me and said dad why you could have  
[0:34:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2048) got paid fifty thousand dollars for this  
[0:34:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2052) so no no son I'm trying to debunk the  
[0:34:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2054) industry I'm trying to get inside there  
[0:34:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2056) I try to shake it up okay yeah whatever  
[0:34:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2058) fifty thousand dollars and he knows that  
[0:34:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2062) the pound is in a magnificent slide it's  
[0:34:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2065) in a swallow dive to the bottom of all  
[0:34:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2067) the currencies at the moment so he's  
[0:34:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2068) thinking that's nearly 50,000 pounds you  
[0:34:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2070) know so the point here is that typing is  
[0:34:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2074) not the bottleneck this is a phrase I  
[0:34:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2076) came up with about 20 years ago and  
[0:34:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2077) Sebastian homido a few years ago created  
[0:34:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2079) this beautiful graphic sometimes we  
[0:34:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2082) approach things as if this is the  
[0:34:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2084) problem in software development maybe  
[0:34:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2086) it's not production maybe it's typing  
[0:34:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2088) speed maybe maybe that's what we need  
[0:34:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2089) we've solved that okay we'll just give  
[0:34:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2091) everybody typing lessons and we'll have  
[0:34:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2093) the debate about keyboard style and all  
[0:34:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2094) the rest of it but this brings us right  
[0:34:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2097) back to this question move fast and  
[0:35:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2100) break things this is a good thing or a  
[0:35:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2101) bad thing I was asked well the short  
[0:35:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2103) answer is it's a thing it's a context  
[0:35:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2107) specific thing context matters when  
[0:35:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2109) apply within the appropriate context it  
[0:35:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2111) can be considered a good thing an  
[0:35:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2112) invitation to experiment I emphasize  
[0:35:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2115) this idea that experimentation I think  
[0:35:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2117) is fundamental to the nature of software  
[0:35:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2118) we are building a thing that is new in  
[0:35:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2121) some way it is either new technology  
[0:35:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2123) it's a new domain and we've got new  
[0:35:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2125) people whatever it is we are doing  
[0:35:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2126) something that is novel in some way  
[0:35:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2128) maybe  
[0:35:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2129) mostly novel 100% of it is know if  
[0:35:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2130) nothing's ever 100% you but maybe it's  
[0:35:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2133) mostly new and requires an immense  
[0:35:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2135) amount of research effort or maybe it's  
[0:35:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2137) a variation of something but the  
[0:35:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2138) variation means that there are things  
[0:35:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2140) that we do not know so this invitation  
[0:35:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2142) to experiment freely without constructed  
[0:35:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2144) without restraint to discover new ways  
[0:35:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2146) of working and thinking if our job is  
[0:35:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2149) knowledge acquisition then thinking is  
[0:35:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2150) part of that and maybe we should be open  
[0:35:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2153) to the idea that you might get a few  
[0:35:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2154) things wrong and you want a framework  
[0:35:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2156) for allowing yourself to get things  
[0:35:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2157) wrong and not completely screw things up  
[0:36:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2160) to break out of an overly comfortable or  
[0:36:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2162) start place on the other hand when  
[0:36:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2165) applied outside the appropriate context  
[0:36:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2167) this whole idea of move fast and break  
[0:36:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2168) things can undermine people in their  
[0:36:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2171) work it's quite arrogant okay it's quite  
[0:36:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2174) irresponsible it means that we start  
[0:36:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2176) making mistakes because we are being  
[0:36:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2178) careless or because we genuinely have  
[0:36:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2181) been careless in the sense of making I'm  
[0:36:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2183) not paying attention but also it means  
[0:36:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2185) that we don't care since apathy so I've  
[0:36:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2189) used the so list of our Facebook our  
[0:36:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2191) weekly talk about any social media  
[0:36:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2192) buying in talk about Facebook because I  
[0:36:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2194) had this rather interesting experience  
[0:36:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2196) where foolishly for some reason I  
[0:36:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2198) decided I would submit a bug report to  
[0:36:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2201) Facebook and I was given this standard  
[0:36:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2206) apply or apply your feedback will be  
[0:36:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2208) used to improve Facebook I have not  
[0:36:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2210) noticed that happening thanks for taking  
[0:36:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2213) the time to mat take a report how much  
[0:36:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2215) time look at the look at the timestamp  
[0:36:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2217) 31st of December 1969 that's that's time  
[0:37:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2221) travel kids that's awesome that's great  
[0:37:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2224) but I don't believe it for a second okay  
[0:37:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2227) so I mean I was I I was alive but I  
[0:37:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2231) don't think I was busy submitting or in  
[0:37:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2233) a position to submit such such a report  
[0:37:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2236) but that's suspicious that's kind of  
[0:37:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2238) like just before the beginning of time  
[0:37:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2239) you want to know about the Big Bang yeah  
[0:37:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2242) so Derrick was only dealing with the  
[0:37:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2244) beginning of time I'm going back further  
[0:37:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2246) knew there's a progression in these  
[0:37:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2248) talks you see I'm going back to the  
[0:37:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2250) moment before the begin recognizing off  
[0:37:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2252) by one era  
[0:37:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2254) I reckon it's time T number seconds unix  
[0:37:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2256) time it's gone minus one and it's just  
[0:37:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2259) taken us back before the first of  
[0:37:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2260) January  
[0:37:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2262) we've got that so yeah we taken a lot of  
[0:37:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2265) time fact let me take you back 10 years  
[0:37:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2268) for those of you who something some of  
[0:37:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2271) you this might bring back fond memories  
[0:37:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2273) okay this is what the Dutch rail website  
[0:37:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2276) used to look like and yeah especially  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2279) the exception  
[0:37:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2279) apparently it turns out that this was a  
[0:38:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2283) well known exception because I use I I  
[0:38:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2285) was visiting a friend I was at a  
[0:38:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2287) conference in Amsterdam and my friend  
[0:38:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2288) was in diving text and I thought I'm  
[0:38:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2290) gonna go and visit him but let me get an  
[0:38:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2292) earlier train there are no earlier  
[0:38:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2294) trains there is only Javadoc not null  
[0:38:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2298) pointer exception yeah you can tell how  
[0:38:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2301) far back this is I mean this is like  
[0:38:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2302) this is I was using brazilís so it's not  
[0:38:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2304) even Firefox or Chrome um but this is  
[0:38:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2308) the interesting thing what we have here  
[0:38:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2310) is a revelation that tells you a great  
[0:38:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2315) deal about a system there's a sort of a  
[0:38:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2318) question here about what's going on it's  
[0:38:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2321) it's basically when you drop a system  
[0:38:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2324) instead of smashing apples here I'm  
[0:38:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2327) going to take some software and I'm  
[0:38:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2328) going to drop it and I'm gonna see where  
[0:38:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2330) it breaks and where it fractures it  
[0:38:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2333) shows you the fault lines it shows you  
[0:38:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2336) how it was built it shows you something  
[0:38:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2338) at that moment you lose all  
[0:39:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2340) encapsulation if you hadn't already  
[0:39:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2341) guessed because of the word servlet if  
[0:39:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2344) you hadn't already guessed this was a  
[0:39:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2345) java-based application it's now visible  
[0:39:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2347) to you when we say encapsulation we  
[0:39:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2351) don't just mean keep stuff private in  
[0:39:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2353) your classes we mean just generally  
[0:39:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2354) don't plaster your technology listing  
[0:39:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2357) all over your URLs that's you know it  
[0:39:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2360) says I've got a perfectly encapsulated  
[0:39:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2361) system so why can I see dot JSP dot RB  
[0:39:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2364) dot PHP whatever in your URL that's a  
[0:39:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2367) that's a betrayal of that and when you  
[0:39:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2369) get a stack trace you get this glory  
[0:39:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2370) you're using that version of Apache at  
[0:39:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2372) the point there is there's a failure and  
[0:39:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2374) you see inside the system you see how it  
[0:39:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2377) was built so I see it's Java I also  
[0:39:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2380) notice other things other things like  
[0:39:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2382) how did this get through surely there's  
[0:39:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2385) an idea that you should never ever let  
[0:39:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2387) this kind of message get through to a  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2389) user  
[0:39:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2389) okay surely there's a big outer try that  
[0:39:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2392) says okay we're going to respond in  
[0:39:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2394) Dutch or in English but we're not gonna  
[0:39:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2395) respond  
[0:39:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2396) okay surely there's this and isn't this  
[0:40:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2400) testable can't we test this and what so  
[0:40:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2403) the other thing is what kind of culture  
[0:40:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2405) produced this what kind of high sense a  
[0:40:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2407) group of developers who are under  
[0:40:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2409) pressure under speed which is reinforced  
[0:40:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2411) a year and a half after this when I  
[0:40:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2413) visited the Netherlands and at a  
[0:40:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2415) conference I used this slide and  
[0:40:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2417) somebody came up to me afterwards they  
[0:40:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2418) said you know they still have that now I  
[0:40:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2422) don't know if this was at the time if  
[0:40:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2424) this was a cherished piece of Dutch  
[0:40:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2426) culture you know it defines what it  
[0:40:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2427) means to be Dutch you know this is this  
[0:40:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2429) is this is us this is how we think yeah  
[0:40:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2431) but to imagine that this bug had been  
[0:40:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2434) there for a year and a half to the point  
[0:40:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2436) that random people on the streets knew  
[0:40:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2439) about it that so I think that team were  
[0:40:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2441) operating under immense speed what the  
[0:40:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2445) quality of the product yeah so anyway  
[0:40:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2448) it's got to the point that I collect  
[0:40:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2450) these things I collect screenshots  
[0:40:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2454) photos of software failure people now  
[0:40:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2457) send me this stuff you know you can tell  
[0:41:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2460) the technology yes in PHP but it's got  
[0:41:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2462) to the point now that somebody actually  
[0:41:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2466) coined last year I'm apparently I'm now  
[0:41:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2469) I'm now a thing a kefflin any screen  
[0:41:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2471) it's calls and indeed this morning on  
[0:41:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2474) the way in well done Paul wherever you  
[0:41:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2477) are so this is fresh from this morning  
[0:41:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2480) oh my way to DevOps Kevin here and  
[0:41:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2481) whoops central brilliant there so  
[0:41:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2484) apparently I'm now a yeah I had a  
[0:41:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2487) question from a friend recently saying  
[0:41:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2488) how does it feel to be identified with  
[0:41:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2491) software failure that's a very good  
[0:41:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2494) question to the point that there's a  
[0:41:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2497) conference in Bristol agile where I live  
[0:41:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2500) agile in the city this was last year my  
[0:41:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2505) the organizer got me he said look  
[0:41:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2507) there's a there's a Kevin any screen  
[0:41:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2509) downstairs I want to take a picture of  
[0:41:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2510) you showing the screen and then I will  
[0:41:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2513) post it and then you can retweet it  
[0:41:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2515) brilliant anyway agile in the city was  
[0:41:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2518) last week so we did this so you know  
[0:42:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2521) this may set up a tradition now a point  
[0:42:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2525) here is that software failures of any  
[0:42:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2527) kind can be amusing and the  
[0:42:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2529) these are often inconvenient in quirky  
[0:42:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2531) you're going through a station and it's  
[0:42:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2533) an inconvenience so you're looking at  
[0:42:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2534) something going on oh I I was hoping I'd  
[0:42:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2536) be able to tell what platform I was  
[0:42:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2539) going to be on but instead I've got a  
[0:42:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2540) Windows reboot screen but sometimes it's  
[0:42:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2543) more expensive sometimes it has greater  
[0:42:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2544) consequence this is an artist's  
[0:42:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2546) impression of the sky ferreira Lander  
[0:42:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2548) for the ExoMars mission it was supposed  
[0:42:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2550) to land on the surface of Mars in  
[0:42:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2553) October last year actually it did land  
[0:42:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2555) on the surface of Mars October last year  
[0:42:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2557) but it's Gizmodo reports not always well  
[0:42:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2560) so yeah Pirellis inertial measurement  
[0:42:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2563) unit went about its business for some  
[0:42:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2564) reason I am you calculate the saturation  
[0:42:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2566) maximum period persisted for one second  
[0:42:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2568) longer than what would normally be  
[0:42:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2569) expected at this stage when the IMU sent  
[0:42:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2572) this bogus information to the Crouse  
[0:42:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2573) navigation system it calculated a  
[0:42:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2575) negative altitude it's positive way is a  
[0:42:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2579) very it's a very sort of framed way of  
[0:43:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2581) saying it was underground so I read the  
[0:43:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2584) the inquiry you've got a loved  
[0:43:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2589) spaceflight oh it's an anomaly an  
[0:43:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2593) anomaly I must use this for cab you  
[0:43:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2595) Larry next time your system goes down  
[0:43:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2597) and causes your customers immense  
[0:43:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2598) distress we apologize for this anomaly  
[0:43:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2601) so I read through it because of the  
[0:43:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2603) error in the estimated attitude that  
[0:43:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2605) occurred parachute inflation GNC  
[0:43:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2606) software projected the range  
[0:43:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2607) measurements with an erroneous off  
[0:43:28](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2608) vertical angle and deduced some negative  
[0:43:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2610) altitude it turns out that the angle the  
[0:43:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2613) calculated angle of the craft was over  
[0:43:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2615) 90 degrees now for those of you who  
[0:43:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2616) remember your trigonometry from school  
[0:43:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2618) if you're taking the cosine of an angle  
[0:43:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2619) over 90 degrees then it goes negative  
[0:43:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2621) and it turns out that this has some  
[0:43:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2623) really interesting consequences it also  
[0:43:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2625) turns out there was no check for this  
[0:43:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2626) impossible situation because that could  
[0:43:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2628) never ever happen and so what happens  
[0:43:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2631) well this thing now thinks it's on it's  
[0:43:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2633) on the ground so what it does is it says  
[0:43:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2635) hey guess what we need to go into  
[0:43:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2637) landing mode so ditches it ditches the  
[0:44:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2640) backshell it ditches the parachute it  
[0:44:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2642) does all of this puts out the Landers  
[0:44:04](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2644) brilliant absolutely only one problem  
[0:44:07](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2647) you're 3,700 meters above the ground now  
[0:44:09](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2649) it turns out that although Martian  
[0:44:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2651) gravity is is only about two-fifths of  
[0:44:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2653) Earth's anything more than zero is  
[0:44:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2655) significant and so indeed scaparelli did  
[0:44:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2658) land and they've seen the crater from  
[0:44:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2660) orbit  
[0:44:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2662) but what we're looking at here it's a  
[0:44:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2665) really interesting point here simple  
[0:44:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2669) testing can prevent most critical  
[0:44:30](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2670) failures this is a testing this is  
[0:44:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2673) wonderful paper that looks at a number  
[0:44:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2676) of production systems and one of the  
[0:44:39](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2679) most interesting ones almost all  
[0:44:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2680) catastrophic failures are the result of  
[0:44:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2682) incorrect handling of non fatal errors  
[0:44:44](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2684) explicitly signaled in the software and  
[0:44:46](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2686) it turns out that we can recreate a vast  
[0:44:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2688) recourse of these if we try it turns out  
[0:44:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2691) that there is a really interesting point  
[0:44:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2694) here now when people look at when they  
[0:44:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2698) think about software failure when they  
[0:45:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2700) think about testing they are looking  
[0:45:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2703) very much at a narrow view of what's  
[0:45:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2706) involved they are thinking of the  
[0:45:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2711) technical stack they're thinking old  
[0:45:12](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2712) testing will slow things down but I want  
[0:45:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2715) to present to you the idea that actually  
[0:45:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2716) testing is a much much bigger thing  
[0:45:19](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2719) there is decided yes testing does slow  
[0:45:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2721) you down at one level but it allows you  
[0:45:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2723) to avoid certain certain surprises this  
[0:45:27](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2727) idea of thinking of the technical stack  
[0:45:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2729) beyond a system gives us this idea it's  
[0:45:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2734) wonderful book christmas is coming  
[0:45:37](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2737) always designers think by considering it  
[0:45:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2740) in its next larger context when people  
[0:45:41](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2741) focus on algorithms when they focus on  
[0:45:43](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2743) the basics of their code they focus on  
[0:45:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2745) simple correctness ideas and they don't  
[0:45:48](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2748) focus on interesting consequences so to  
[0:45:50](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2750) go back a year we have this interesting  
[0:45:53](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2753) well I'm not just blaming Facebook here  
[0:45:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2754) it's just that they have a readily  
[0:45:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2755) identifiable brand it's true of many  
[0:45:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2757) things Facebook is now in the awkward  
[0:45:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2759) position having to explain why they  
[0:46:00](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2760) think they drive purchase decisions but  
[0:46:01](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2761) not voting decisions their systems are  
[0:46:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2763) optimized for giving us more of what we  
[0:46:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2765) think we want they are organized to  
[0:46:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2768) influence and how much do they influence  
[0:46:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2770) us some of you may or may not be aware  
[0:46:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2773) of this experiment that Facebook ran a  
[0:46:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2775) couple of years ago we show via a  
[0:46:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2778) massive experiment on facebook that  
[0:46:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2781) emotional states can be transferred via  
[0:46:23](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2783) emotional contagion leading people to  
[0:46:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2785) experience the same emotions without  
[0:46:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2786) their awareness that N equals nearly  
[0:46:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2789) 700,000 is a reference to the number of  
[0:46:31](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2791) participants who did not know that they  
[0:46:33](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2793) were volunteering for this this is quite  
[0:46:35](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2795) important because  
[0:46:36](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2796) Facebook actually changed its terms and  
[0:46:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2798) conditions' about a month after this to  
[0:46:40](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2800) kind of retrofit it it turns out that  
[0:46:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2802) you can make people happier or sadder at  
[0:46:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2805) this mass influence level by adjusting  
[0:46:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2807) the content of their feed and the point  
[0:46:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2811) is that feed was optimized for one  
[0:46:52](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2812) particular reason and it does it very  
[0:46:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2814) well but now what we're doing is we're  
[0:46:56](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2816) seeing this stuff and love you've got oh  
[0:46:57](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2817) this is terrible this is terrible this  
[0:46:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2819) is just like a beater stream you see a  
[0:47:03](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2823) bee testing is based for a commercial  
[0:47:05](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2825) product there is the idea of well yes if  
[0:47:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2828) we use this approach it empties people's  
[0:47:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2830) bank accounts to buy our products faster  
[0:47:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2831) now is that more or less moral I'm not  
[0:47:14](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2834) going to answer that question I just  
[0:47:15](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2835) want to offer you the sense that when we  
[0:47:17](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2837) come to test and frame and specify and  
[0:47:20](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2840) think about our systems there is a  
[0:47:22](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2842) continuum somewhere between innocent a  
[0:47:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2844) be testing what is the better website  
[0:47:26](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2846) and the extreme emotional contagion with  
[0:47:29](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2849) major side effects and if we're running  
[0:47:32](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2852) around at speed we're gonna miss stuff  
[0:47:34](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2854) so what I like to do is just end with  
[0:47:38](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2858) this idea that yeah move fast and break  
[0:47:42](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2862) things make sense but we need to  
[0:47:45](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2865) understand the context in which it makes  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2867) sense  
[0:47:47](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2867) software is by its nature and  
[0:47:49](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2869) experimental activity it's also  
[0:47:51](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2871) utilitarian commercial activity and we  
[0:47:54](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2874) need to understand where those  
[0:47:55](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2875) boundaries lie and we need to understand  
[0:47:58](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2878) that some of the time we need to kind of  
[0:47:59](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2879) pause we need to slow down you get  
[0:48:02](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2882) faster sometimes by pausing okay in  
[0:48:06](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2886) other words don't spend more time doing  
[0:48:08](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2888) the wrong thing with greater energy that  
[0:48:10](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2890) may look more visible but it's a case  
[0:48:11](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2891) like hang on what would be the better  
[0:48:13](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2893) option here what what mistakes have we  
[0:48:16](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2896) made that I can now fix and ultimately  
[0:48:18](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2898) it comes down to learning thank you very  
[0:48:21](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2901) much  
[0:48:24](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2904) you  
[0:48:25](https://youtu.be/1kklyq4XYpw?t=2905) [Music]
